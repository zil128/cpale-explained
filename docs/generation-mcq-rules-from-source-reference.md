## RULE FOR GENERATION OF MCQ USING SOURCE REFERENCE
## SOURCE REFERENCE


from this md file, you will see learning and review lesson, and a multiple MCQs, just get the concept, do not copy verbatim. if you see names and locations, change to other names (GenZ approach) and change the location name, if you see date, change the year of that date plus 5 years (e.g. 2020 + 5, create to 2025).  If you see long method of computation like multiple line items for the computation, use that pattern also, rearrange it, just change the amount but will arrive on the same concept of solution
