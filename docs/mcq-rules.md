sample MCQ QUESTION 

36 A buyer discovered that the thing sold had a hidden defect that made it unfit for its intended use. 
What is the proper legal action to cancel the sale? A. Accion reinvindicatoria B. Accion redhibitoria C. Accion publiciana D. Accion pauliana

 ✅ Correct Answer B. Accion redhibitoria 

🏠 Illustration = Real-Life Scenario (Very Simple) 
You buy a refrigerator.
    • It looks fine when delivered
    • After using it, you discover: 
        ○ It cannot cool properly
    • You later learn: 
        ○ The defect already existed at the time of sale You don’t want a discount. You don’t want repairs. 👉 You want to return the refrigerator and get your money back. 
        ○ 🧠 Breaking Down the Legal Term (So It Makes Sense) Accion → 
        ○ action or lawsuit Redhibitoria → to return or give back 
        ○ 👉 Accion redhibitoria = an action to return the thing and cancel the sale In simple words: This is the buyer’s lawsuit to cancel the sale because of a hidden and serious defect. 
        ○ 
        ○ 📘 Formal Legal Meaning (Reviewer-Level, Still Simple) Accion redhibitoria (redhibitory action) is a legal remedy in civil law that allows a buyer to rescind or cancel a sale when the thing sold has a hidden defect so serious that:
    • It makes the thing unfit for its intended use, or
    • It makes the use extremely inconvenient, and
    • The buyer would not have bought it if the defect were known The result:
    • The buyer returns the item
    • The seller returns the price paid, plus interest and expenses ✅ Conditions for Accion Redhibitoria (Easy Checklist) All must be present: ✔ The defect is hidden ✔ The defect is serious ✔ The defect existed at the time of sale ✔ The buyer was unaware of the defect ✔ The defect makes the thing unfit or extremely inconvenient If these are present → Accion redhibitoria applies 🔄 Distinguished from a Similar Remedy If the buyer says: “I’ll keep the item, but I want a lower price.” That is NOT accion redhibitoria. That remedy is: 👉 Accion quanti minoris (Price reduction instead of cancellation) ❌ Why the Other Choices Are Wrong ❌ A. Accion reinvindicatoria Reivindicar → to recover ownership
    • Used by an owner to recover property from someone else
    • ❌ Not about defects
    • ❌ Not about canceling a sale ❌ C. Accion publiciana
    • Used to recover possession, not ownership
    • ❌ Not related to defects
    • ❌ Not a remedy to cancel a sale ❌ D. Accion pauliana
    • Used by creditors
    • Purpose: to rescind fraudulent transfers made to prejudice creditors
    • ❌ Not a buyer’s remedy
    • ❌ Not about defective goods 📜 Legal Basis Civil Code, Article 1567 “In the cases of Articles 1561 and 1566, the buyer may elect between withdrawing from the contract and demanding a proportionate reduction of the price…” 🎯 CPALE Memory Trigger 👉 Hidden defect + cancel the sale = ACCION REDHIBITORIA
