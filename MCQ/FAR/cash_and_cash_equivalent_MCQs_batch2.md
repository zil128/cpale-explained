### MCQ 21: Cash Definition

**Question:**
Cash comprises which of the following?

A. Cash on hand and time deposits
B. Cash on hand and demand deposits
C. Cash equivalents and time deposits
D. Demand deposits and treasury bills

**✅ Correct Answer: B. Cash on hand and demand deposits**

---

**🏠 Illustration = Real-Life Scenario**

Think of "cash" as money you can spend RIGHT NOW without waiting:
- Bills in your wallet (cash on hand) ✓
- Money in your BDO savings you can withdraw via ATM (demand deposit) ✓
- Time deposit locked for 6 months? ✗ Can't touch it now!

---

**📘 Formal Definition**
Per PAS 7, **Cash** comprises:
- Cash on hand (currencies, coins)
- Demand deposits (savings accounts, checking accounts that can be withdrawn anytime without prior notice)

Time deposits and treasury bills may qualify as cash EQUIVALENTS, but not as CASH itself.

---

**✅ Elements Checklist:**
| Item | Cash? | Why? |
|------|-------|------|
| Currency and coins | ✓ | Cash on hand |
| Savings account | ✓ | Demand deposit |
| Checking account | ✓ | Demand deposit |
| Time deposit | ✗ | Has maturity date |
| Treasury bill | ✗ | Investment, may be cash equivalent |

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Time deposits are NOT cash (have maturity)
- **C**: Cash equivalents are separate from cash
- **D**: Treasury bills are cash equivalents, not cash

---

**📜 Reference:** PAS 7, Paragraph 6

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Cash = On Hand + On Demand"

---
---

### MCQ 22: Cash Equivalents Characteristics

**Question:**
Which characteristic is NOT required for an investment to be classified as a cash equivalent?

A. Short-term maturity
B. Highly liquid
C. Insignificant risk of value changes
D. Earns interest income

**✅ Correct Answer: D. Earns interest income**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

A cash equivalent is like a "waiting room" for your cash - close enough to grab quickly when needed.

Requirements:
✓ Short stay (3 months or less from acquisition to maturity)
✓ Can convert to cash quickly (highly liquid)
✓ Value won't suddenly drop (insignificant risk)

But does it need to earn interest? NOPE! Some cash equivalents may have zero or minimal interest.

---

**📘 Formal Definition**
Per PAS 7, paragraph 7, cash equivalents are:
1. **Short-term** (3 months or less from acquisition)
2. **Highly liquid** (readily convertible to known cash amounts)
3. **Insignificant value risk**

Earning interest is NOT a requirement - it's just a common feature.

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Short-term IS required (3-month rule)
- **B**: Highly liquid IS required
- **C**: Insignificant risk IS required

---

**📜 Reference:** PAS 7, Paragraph 7

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Cash Equivalent = SHI: Short-term, Highly liquid, Insignificant risk"

---
---

### MCQ 23: Three-Month Rule

**Question:**
GlowUp Corporation acquired a 1-year treasury bill on October 15, 2030. The treasury bill matures on January 15, 2031. How should this investment be classified on December 31, 2030?

A. Cash equivalent
B. Short-term investment
C. Cash
D. Long-term investment

**✅ Correct Answer: A. Cash equivalent**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

Timeline check:
- Acquired: October 15, 2030
- Maturity: January 15, 2031
- Time from acquisition to maturity: 3 months exactly!

The 3-month rule is measured from ACQUISITION DATE to MATURITY DATE, not from year-end!

Since it's exactly 3 months (or less), it qualifies as a cash equivalent.

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

The **three-month rule** for cash equivalents:
- Count from DATE OF ACQUISITION to MATURITY DATE
- NOT from balance sheet date
- 3 months or less = Cash equivalent
- More than 3 months = Other investment

---

**✅ Calculation:**
| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Oct 15, 2030 | Acquired |
| Jan 15, 2031 | Matures |
| Duration | 3 months ✓ |

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **B**: Meets cash equivalent criteria, not just short-term investment
- **C**: Investments are not cash itself
- **D**: Matures within 12 months, not long-term

---

**📜 Reference:** PAS 7, Paragraph 7

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "3-Month Rule: Count from BUY date, not BALANCE SHEET date"

---
---

### MCQ 24: Postdated Check Treatment

**Question:**
BussinCo received a ₱50,000 check from a customer dated February 15, 2031 on December 20, 2030. How should this be classified on December 31, 2030?

A. Cash
B. Cash equivalent
C. Accounts receivable
D. Notes receivable

**✅ Correct Answer: C. Accounts receivable**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

Imagine your friend gives you a check dated NEXT MONTH.

You: "Can I deposit this now?"
Bank: "Nope, wait until the date on the check!"

Until February 15, that check is just a fancy piece of paper. You STILL have a receivable from your friend!

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Postdated checks** are checks dated in the future. They:
- Cannot be deposited until the date indicated
- Are NOT negotiable until that date
- Should be classified as **Accounts Receivable** (or Other Receivable)
- Are EXCLUDED from cash

---

**✅ Classification Logic:**
| Check Type | Classification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Current-dated | Cash |
| Postdated | Receivable |
| NSF (bounced) | Receivable |
| Stale (too old) | Receivable |

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Cannot deposit until future date
- **B**: Cash equivalents are investments, not checks
- **D**: Notes receivable require a promissory note

---

**📜 Reference:** PAS 7, Paragraph 6; General cash classification principles

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Postdated Check = Future Date = Future Collection = Receivable NOW"

---
---

### MCQ 25: Stale Check Treatment

**Question:**
AestheticCorp found a customer check dated March 15, 2029 in its files on December 31, 2030. How should this check be classified?

A. Cash
B. Unclaimed deposit
C. Accounts receivable
D. Write-off to bad debt expense

**✅ Correct Answer: C. Accounts receivable**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

You found an old check from 2029 - that's almost 2 years old!

Banks typically won't honor checks older than 6 months (stale checks). But you still have a claim against the customer who gave it to you.

It's not cash (bank won't accept it), but it's a receivable (customer still owes you).

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Stale checks** are checks that have been outstanding for an extended period (typically 6+ months). They:
- May not be honored by banks
- Are EXCLUDED from cash
- Should be reclassified as **Accounts Receivable**
- The company should contact the customer for a replacement check

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Banks won't accept stale checks
- **B**: "Unclaimed deposit" is not a standard classification
- **D**: Only write off if collection is truly doubtful; first reclassify to receivable

---

**📜 Reference:** General cash classification principles; Banking practices

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Stale Check = Old and Cold = Not Cash, Still Owed"

---
---

### MCQ 26: Money Order Classification

**Question:**
Which of the following is correctly classified as part of cash on hand?

A. Postage stamps
B. Employee IOU
C. Postal money order
D. Credit memo from supplier

**✅ Correct Answer: C. Postal money order**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

You're sorting through the petty cash drawer:
- Postage stamps? Those are SUPPLIES, not cash!
- Employee IOU? That's a RECEIVABLE!
- Money order? YES! It's like a guaranteed check - totally cash!
- Supplier credit memo? That reduces your payables, not cash!

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Cash on hand** includes:
- Currencies and coins
- Bank drafts
- **Money orders** (postal or bank)
- Cashier's/Manager's/Certified checks
- Traveler's checks

**NOT cash:**
- Postage stamps (supplies)
- IOUs (receivables)
- Credit memos (contra-purchase)

---

**✅ Classification:**
| Item | Classification |
|------|---------------|
| Money order | Cash ✓ |
| Bank draft | Cash ✓ |
| Postage stamps | Supplies |
| IOU | Receivable |
| Credit memo | Contra A/P |

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Postage stamps are office supplies
- **B**: IOUs are advances/receivables from employees
- **D**: Credit memos reduce accounts payable, not cash

---

**📜 Reference:** PAS 7, Paragraph 6

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Money Order = Money Guaranteed = Cash!"

---

### MCQ 27: Foreign Currency Valuation

**Question:**
LitAF Corporation has $50,000 in a US dollar account at BPI. On December 31, 2030, the exchange rates are:
- Rate when account was opened (July 1, 2030): ₱52
- Average rate for 2030: ₱54
- Closing rate December 31, 2030: ₱56

At what amount should this be reported in the statement of financial position?

A. ₱2,600,000
B. ₱2,700,000
C. ₱2,800,000
D. ₱5,600,000

**✅ Correct Answer: C. ₱2,800,000**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

Your USD savings is like having foreign currency - you need to convert it to pesos for reporting.

Which rate to use?
- Historical rate (when you opened it)? NO
- Average rate? NO
- CLOSING RATE (December 31)? YES!

Cash in foreign currency is a monetary item, always valued at the CURRENT exchange rate.

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

Per **PAS 21**, foreign currency monetary items (including cash) must be translated using the **closing rate** (spot rate at balance sheet date).

Formula: Foreign Currency Amount × Closing Rate = Peso Equivalent

---

**✅ Computation:**
$50,000 × ₱56 (closing rate) = **₱2,800,000**

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: ₱2,600,000 uses historical rate (₱52)
- **B**: ₱2,700,000 uses average rate (₱54)
- **D**: ₱5,600,000 is a calculation error

---

**📜 Reference:** PAS 21, Paragraph 23

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Foreign Cash = Closing Rate, Always Current!"

---
---

### MCQ 28: Deposit in Closed Bank

**Question:**
ChillVibes Inc. has ₱500,000 deposited in a bank that was placed under receivership by BSP. The estimated recovery is ₱0.60 per peso. How should this be reported?

A. Cash and cash equivalents at ₱500,000
B. Cash and cash equivalents at ₱300,000
C. Receivable at ₱300,000
D. Written off as loss

**✅ Correct Answer: C. Receivable at ₱300,000**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

Your bank just closed! 😱

You had ₱500,000 there, but the bank is in trouble. The government says you'll only get back 60 centavos for every peso.

Is this still "cash"? NO - you can't withdraw it!
Is it a receivable? YES - you have a claim against the bank for what you can recover!

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Deposits in closed banks** or banks under receivership:
- Are EXCLUDED from cash (not available for use)
- Should be classified as **Receivables**
- Valued at **estimated recoverable amount**

---

**✅ Computation:**
₱500,000 × 0.60 = **₱300,000** (reported as receivable)

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Not accessible, cannot be cash at full value
- **B**: Cash classification is wrong, even if amount is correct
- **D**: Still has recoverable value, not fully written off

---

**📜 Reference:** General accounting principles; PAS 7 (cash definition)

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Closed Bank = Closed for Cash = Open for Receivable"

---
---

### MCQ 29: Fund Classification

**Question:**
Which of the following funds should be INCLUDED in cash and cash equivalents?

A. Bond sinking fund
B. Pension fund
C. Payroll fund
D. Plant expansion fund

**✅ Correct Answer: C. Payroll fund**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

Different "piggy banks" at the company:
- Bond sinking fund: Set aside to pay bonds in the FUTURE → Non-current
- Pension fund: For employees' retirement → Non-current
- **Payroll fund: To pay salaries THIS MONTH** → Current operations → CASH!
- Plant expansion fund: For future factory → Non-current

Only the payroll fund is for CURRENT OPERATIONS!

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Funds included in Cash:**
- Petty cash fund
- Payroll fund
- Dividend fund (if for current dividends)
- Change fund
- Tax fund
- Travel fund

**Funds EXCLUDED from Cash (Non-current assets):**
- Bond sinking fund
- Pension fund
- Plant expansion fund
- Contingency fund

---

**✅ Classification Rule:**
| Fund Purpose | Classification |
|-------------|---------------|
| Current operations | Cash |
| Future obligations | Non-current asset |

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Bond sinking fund is for future bond redemption
- **B**: Pension fund is for future employee benefits
- **D**: Plant expansion is for future capital expenditure

---

**📜 Reference:** PAS 1 (current vs non-current); PAS 7 (cash definition)

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Current Operations Fund = Current Cash; Future Fund = Non-current Asset"

---
---

### MCQ 30: Unreleased Check Treatment

**Question:**
On December 31, 2030, FreshDrip Company prepared a check for ₱100,000 payable to a supplier. The check was dated December 31, 2030, recorded in the books, but kept in the company safe and mailed on January 10, 2031.

What is the effect on cash balance at December 31, 2030?

A. Cash is correctly stated
B. Cash is understated by ₱100,000
C. Cash is overstated by ₱100,000
D. No effect on cash

**✅ Correct Answer: B. Cash is understated by ₱100,000**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

You wrote a check but didn't mail it - it's still in your drawer!

The bookkeeper recorded: "Paid supplier ₱100,000" (deducted from cash)
Reality: The check is still with you! You still have that money!

Your cash is UNDERSTATED because you deducted something you haven't actually given away yet.

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Unreleased checks** (checks prepared and recorded but not yet delivered to payees):
- Should NOT be deducted from cash yet
- Control has not passed to the payee
- Must be ADDED BACK to cash balance

This is a common year-end cut-off adjustment.

---

**✅ Analysis:**
| Status | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Check recorded (deducted) | Cash decreased |
| Check not mailed | Cash should NOT decrease |
| Net effect | Cash UNDERSTATED |
| Correction | Add back ₱100,000 |

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Cash is NOT correctly stated
- **C**: Cash is understated, not overstated
- **D**: There IS an effect - improper cut-off

---

**📜 Reference:** Cut-off procedures; Accrual accounting principles

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Unreleased Check = Unreleased Cash = Add Back!"

---
---

### MCQ 31: Company's Postdated Check Issued

**Question:**
SleighCorp issued a check dated January 31, 2031 to a supplier on December 28, 2030. The check was recorded and mailed on December 28, 2030.

How should this affect SleighCorp's December 31, 2030 financial statements?

A. Deduct from cash, recognize accounts payable reduction
B. No effect on cash, accounts payable remains
C. Add back to cash, accounts payable remains
D. Add back to cash, recognize accounts payable reduction

**✅ Correct Answer: C. Add back to cash, accounts payable remains**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

You gave your landlord a check dated NEXT MONTH for rent.

Did you really "pay" yet? NO! The landlord can't cash it until January 31!

So on December 31:
- You still have the cash (in effect)
- You still owe the landlord

The entry recording the payment was PREMATURE - need to reverse it!

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Postdated checks issued** by the company:
- Cannot be negotiated by the payee until the check date
- Are NOT valid disbursements until that date
- Should be ADDED BACK to cash
- Accounts payable should remain unpaid

---

**✅ Required Adjustment:**
```
Cash in Bank                 xxx
    Accounts Payable              xxx
(To reverse premature payment recording)
```

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Check isn't valid payment yet
- **B**: There IS an effect - cash was incorrectly reduced
- **D**: A/P was reduced in books, must be restored

---

**📜 Reference:** Cut-off procedures; Check negotiability rules

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Postdated Check OUT = Not Out Yet = Cash Still In!"

---
---

### MCQ 32: Traveler's Check Classification

**Question:**
BruhMoment Travel Agency has ₱200,000 worth of unused traveler's checks on hand at year-end. How should this be classified?

A. Prepaid expenses
B. Cash on hand
C. Short-term investments
D. Advances to employees

**✅ Correct Answer: B. Cash on hand**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

Traveler's checks are like prepaid cash for travelers - you can use them almost anywhere like regular money.

They're:
- Prepaid ✓
- Widely accepted ✓
- As good as cash ✓

So yes, they're CASH!

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Traveler's checks** are prepaid negotiable instruments that:
- Are widely accepted as payment
- Can be easily converted to cash
- Are considered **cash on hand**

They are NOT:
- Prepaid expenses (those are services to be received)
- Investments (those earn returns)

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Prepaid expenses are for future services/goods
- **C**: Traveler's checks don't earn investment returns
- **D**: Not advances to anyone

---

**📜 Reference:** PAS 7, Paragraph 6

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Traveler's Check = Travels Like Cash = IS Cash!"

---
---

### MCQ 33: Manager's Check

**Question:**
Which statement about a manager's check is CORRECT?

A. It is a check drawn by a customer against their own account
B. It is a check drawn by the bank against its own funds
C. It cannot be included in cash because it has a future date
D. It must be held for 3 months before classification as cash

**✅ Correct Answer: B. It is a check drawn by the bank against its own funds**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

A manager's check is the bank saying: "WE guarantee this payment."

It's drawn against the BANK's funds, not a customer's potentially empty account. That's why it's so reliable - banks don't bounce!

Types of bank-guaranteed checks:
- Manager's check
- Cashier's check
- Certified check

All are as good as cash!

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Manager's check** (also called cashier's check):
- Drawn by the bank against its OWN funds
- Guaranteed by the bank
- Cannot bounce (bank ensures funds)
- Classified as **cash**

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: That's a personal/customer check, not manager's check
- **C**: Manager's checks are current-dated and negotiable
- **D**: No holding period required - it's immediately cash

---

**📜 Reference:** Banking practices; Cash classification principles

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Manager's Check = Bank's Money = Guaranteed Cash!"

---
---

### MCQ 34: Cash Surrender Value

**Question:**
TrendyFinance Inc. has a life insurance policy with a cash surrender value of ₱1,500,000. How should this be classified?

A. Cash and cash equivalents
B. Short-term investment
C. Long-term investment
D. Prepaid insurance

**✅ Correct Answer: C. Long-term investment**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

Your company has life insurance on key executives. If you cancel the policy, you get back the "cash surrender value."

But is it cash? NO!
- You'd have to CANCEL the policy to get it
- That's not readily available
- It's more like a long-term savings embedded in insurance

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Cash surrender value (CSV)** is the amount an insurance company pays if a policy is cancelled. It is:
- NOT cash (not readily available without cancelling policy)
- NOT a current asset (typically)
- Classified as **Long-term Investment** or Other Non-current Asset

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Not readily available as cash
- **B**: Usually not current (long-term policy)
- **D**: It's not a prepayment for future coverage

---

**📜 Reference:** PAS 1 (asset classification); Insurance accounting

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "CSV = Cancel to get cash = Not Current = Long-term Investment"

---
---

### MCQ 35: Equity Securities Classification

**Question:**
CrispyInvestments has ₱800,000 in actively traded ordinary shares designated as FVPL, expected to be sold within 3 months. Should this be classified as a cash equivalent?

A. Yes, because it will be sold within 3 months
B. Yes, because it is highly liquid
C. No, because equity investments are never cash equivalents
D. No, because it is subject to significant risk of value changes

**✅ Correct Answer: D. No, because it is subject to significant risk of value changes**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

You bought stocks planning to sell them in 2 months. Cash equivalent?

Let's check the requirements:
✓ Short-term? Yes, 2 months
✓ Highly liquid? Yes, actively traded
✗ Insignificant value risk? NO! Stock prices can crash overnight!

Stocks are too risky to be cash equivalents - their value can swing wildly!

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Equity investments** (shares of stock) are EXCLUDED from cash equivalents because:
- They are subject to **significant risk of value changes**
- Stock prices fluctuate based on market conditions
- This violates the "insignificant risk" requirement

Even if sold quickly, the unpredictable value disqualifies them.

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Short-term alone doesn't qualify it
- **B**: Liquidity alone doesn't qualify it
- **C**: "Never" is too absolute - technically redeemable preference shares near maturity CAN qualify

---

**📜 Reference:** PAS 7, Paragraph 7

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Stocks = Risky = Not Cash Equivalent, No Matter How Quick!"

---
---

### MCQ 36: Preference Shares as Cash Equivalent

**Question:**
On December 1, 2030, MidCorp acquired redeemable preference shares that will be mandatorily redeemed on February 28, 2031. How should this be classified on December 31, 2030?

A. Short-term investment at FVPL
B. Cash equivalent
C. Long-term investment
D. Equity investment at FVOCI

**✅ Correct Answer: B. Cash equivalent**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

These preference shares are SPECIAL:
- They MUST be redeemed (mandatory)
- Redemption is in 3 months (Dec 1 to Feb 28)
- You know exactly how much you'll get back

It's like a bond that matures soon - predictable value, short-term, liquid. CASH EQUIVALENT!

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

Per **PAS 7, paragraph 7**, preference shares CAN qualify as cash equivalents IF:
1. Acquired within **3 months before redemption date**
2. Have a **specified redemption date** (mandatory redemption)

These are essentially debt instruments disguised as equity, with fixed maturity and known value.

---

**✅ Analysis:**
| Requirement | Met? |
|-------------|------|
| 3 months from acquisition to maturity | ✓ (Dec 1 to Feb 28 = 3 months) |
| Specified redemption date | ✓ (Mandatory Feb 28, 2031) |
| Known redemption value | ✓ |
| Classification | Cash Equivalent ✓ |

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Meets stricter cash equivalent criteria
- **C**: Matures in 3 months, not long-term
- **D**: Redeemable prefs are more like debt than equity

---

**📜 Reference:** PAS 7, Paragraph 7

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Redeemable Pref + 3 Months to Redemption = Cash Equivalent!"

---
---

### MCQ 37: Bank Overdraft - Same Bank

**Question:**
CapCorp has two accounts at BDO:
- Checking Account A: ₱500,000
- Checking Account B: (₱150,000) overdraft

CapCorp has a legal right to offset with BDO. How should these be reported?

A. Cash ₱500,000; Current liability ₱150,000
B. Cash ₱350,000
C. Cash ₱500,000; reduce shareholders' equity ₱150,000
D. Net cash (₱150,000) as current liability

**✅ Correct Answer: B. Cash ₱350,000**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

Both accounts are at BDO, and BDO said you can offset them.

It's like having two pockets - one has ₱500 and the other is -₱150 (you borrowed from the bank).

Since it's the SAME bank with offset rights, you just combine them:
₱500,000 - ₱150,000 = ₱350,000 net cash

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Bank overdrafts** at the SAME bank may be offset against positive balances IF:
1. Both accounts are at the **same bank**
2. Entity has **legal right to offset**
3. Entity **intends to settle net**

When offset is allowed, report the NET amount as cash.

---

**✅ Computation:**
₱500,000 - ₱150,000 = **₱350,000** (reported as cash)

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Offset is allowed, should not report separately
- **C**: Overdraft doesn't affect equity
- **D**: Net is positive, not negative

---

**📜 Reference:** PAS 7, Paragraph 8; PAS 32, Paragraph 42

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Same Bank + Offset Right = Report NET Cash"

---
---

### MCQ 38: Compensating Balance - Unrestricted

**Question:**
WokeFinance borrowed ₱10,000,000 from Metro Bank with a requirement to maintain a compensating balance of ₱1,000,000. The balance is NOT legally restricted from withdrawal. How should the compensating balance be classified?

A. Other current assets
B. Other non-current assets
C. Cash and cash equivalents
D. Deducted from the loan payable

**✅ Correct Answer: C. Cash and cash equivalents**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

The bank "suggests" keeping ₱1,000,000 as a cushion for your loan.

But can you withdraw it if you really need to? YES!
There's no legal restriction - just a bank preference.

If you CAN use it, it's still your CASH!

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Compensating balance** classification depends on LEGAL RESTRICTION:

| Restriction | Classification |
|-------------|---------------|
| **NOT legally restricted** | Cash and cash equivalents |
| Legally restricted + short-term loan | Other current assets |
| Legally restricted + long-term loan | Other non-current assets |

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Only if legally restricted with short-term loan
- **B**: Only if legally restricted with long-term loan
- **D**: Compensating balance is an asset, not contra-liability

---

**📜 Reference:** PAS 7 (cash definition); Disclosure requirements

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Can Withdraw = Cash; Can't Withdraw = Separate Asset"

---
---

### MCQ 39: Internal Control - Segregation

**Question:**
Which of the following represents the BEST internal control practice for cash?

A. The cashier should also maintain the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger
B. The person who reconciles the bank statement should also sign checks
C. Daily cash receipts should be deposited intact by the end of the business day
D. The petty cash custodian should also approve petty cash reimbursements

**✅ Correct Answer: C. Daily cash receipts should be deposited intact by the end of the business day**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

Good cash control is like having security cameras AND guards AND locks - multiple layers!

Bad practice: One person handles cash AND records it (they could steal and hide it!)

Good practice: Deposit cash DAILY so:
- Less cash sitting around to tempt people
- Creates a clear audit trail
- Bank statement becomes independent verification

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Key internal controls for cash:**
1. **Segregation of duties** - separate handling from recording
2. **Daily deposit** of all cash receipts intact
3. **Use checks** for disbursements (creates paper trail)
4. **Monthly bank reconciliation** by independent person
5. **Imprest system** for petty cash

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Cashier handling cash AND recording A/R = no segregation
- **B**: Reconciler signing checks = no segregation
- **D**: Custodian approving own expenses = no segregation

---

**📜 Reference:** Internal control frameworks; Best practices

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Cash Control = Separate, Deposit Daily, Check Everything!"

### MCQ 40: Cash Presentation

**Question:**
According to PAS 1, when should cash and cash equivalents be presented as NON-current assets?

A. When the balance exceeds ₱1,000,000
B. When management intends to hold it for more than one year
C. When restricted from use for at least twelve months after reporting date
D. When denominated in foreign currency

**✅ Correct Answer: C. When restricted from use for at least twelve months after reporting date**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

Normally, cash is CURRENT - you can use it anytime.

But what if a court order says: "Don't touch this ₱5 million for the next 2 years pending the lawsuit!"

That's RESTRICTED cash - you can't use it for at least 12 months. So it becomes NON-current!

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

Per **PAS 1**, cash is presented as **non-current** when:
- **Restricted from being exchanged or used** to settle a liability
- Restriction period is **at least twelve months** after reporting date

Otherwise, cash is always current regardless of:
- Amount
- Management intention
- Currency denomination

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Amount doesn't determine classification
- **B**: Management intent alone doesn't change classification
- **D**: Foreign currency cash is still current if unrestricted

---

**📜 Reference:** PAS 1, Paragraph 66; PAS 7

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Restricted 12+ Months = Non-current; Otherwise = Current!"

### MCQ 41: Imprest vs Fluctuating System

**Question:**
Under which petty cash system are expenses recorded at the time of disbursement?

A. Imprest system only
B. Fluctuating system only
C. Both systems
D. Neither system

**✅ Correct Answer: B. Fluctuating system only**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

**Imprest System** (like a prepaid load):
- Start with ₱10,000
- Spend ₱3,000 on supplies (NO ENTRY yet!)
- Replenish: Record ₱3,000 supplies expense, reload to ₱10,000

**Fluctuating System** (like a regular wallet):
- Start with ₱10,000
- Spend ₱3,000 on supplies → IMMEDIATELY record: Dr. Supplies, Cr. PCF
- Fund balance goes to ₱7,000

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

| System | When Expenses Recorded |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Imprest** | At REPLENISHMENT |
| **Fluctuating** | At DISBURSEMENT |

---

**Journal Entries Comparison:**

**Imprest - Disbursement:**
```
No entry
```

**Fluctuating - Disbursement:**
```
Expense                xxx
    Petty Cash Fund        xxx
```

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Imprest records at replenishment, not disbursement
- **C**: Only fluctuating records at disbursement
- **D**: Fluctuating does record at disbursement

---

**📜 Reference:** Petty cash accounting procedures

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Imprest = Record at Replenish; Fluctuating = Record When You Flush (spend)"

---
---

### MCQ 42: Petty Cash Establishment

**Question:**
SkibiTech established a petty cash fund of ₱25,000. What is the journal entry?

A. Petty Cash Fund 25,000 / Cash in Bank 25,000
B. Cash in Bank 25,000 / Petty Cash Fund 25,000
C. Miscellaneous Expense 25,000 / Cash in Bank 25,000
D. Petty Cash Fund 25,000 / Miscellaneous Expense 25,000

**✅ Correct Answer: A. Petty Cash Fund 25,000 / Cash in Bank 25,000**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

You're setting up a petty cash drawer with ₱25,000.

Where does the money come from? Your bank account!
Where does it go? To the petty cash fund!

It's just moving money from one pocket (bank) to another pocket (petty cash drawer).

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Establishment entry** (same for both Imprest and Fluctuating):
```
Petty Cash Fund         25,000
    Cash in Bank            25,000
```

This entry:
- Creates the petty cash fund asset
- Reduces the cash in bank asset
- NO expense is recorded yet!

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **B**: Reversed - would mean bank increased and PCF decreased
- **C**: No expense incurred yet
- **D**: Makes no sense - expense doesn't create fund

---

**📜 Reference:** Petty cash accounting procedures

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Establish = Move Money: Dr. PCF (new home), Cr. CIB (old home)"

### MCQ 43: Imprest Replenishment Entry

**Question:**
At month-end, the petty cash fund shows:
- Cash on hand: ₱3,500
- Paid vouchers: Transportation ₱4,200, Supplies ₱2,100, Miscellaneous ₱1,200

The imprest balance is ₱11,000. What is the replenishment entry?

A. Petty Cash Fund 7,500 / Cash in Bank 7,500
B. Various Expenses 7,500 / Cash in Bank 7,500
C. Various Expenses 7,500 / Petty Cash Fund 7,500
D. Cash in Bank 7,500 / Various Expenses 7,500

**✅ Correct Answer: B. Various Expenses 7,500 / Cash in Bank 7,500**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

Imprest system replenishment:
1. Count what's left: ₱3,500 cash
2. Add up vouchers: ₱4,200 + ₱2,100 + ₱1,200 = ₱7,500
3. Check: ₱3,500 + ₱7,500 = ₱11,000 ✓ No shortage!
4. Replenish: Write a ₱7,500 check to bring fund back to ₱11,000
5. Record the EXPENSES, not the petty cash fund!

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Imprest Replenishment** (no shortage/overage):
```
Transportation Expense      4,200
Supplies Expense           2,100
Miscellaneous Expense      1,200
    Cash in Bank               7,500
```

Key point: **Petty Cash Fund account is NOT touched** during normal replenishment under imprest system!

---

**✅ Computation:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Transportation | ₱4,200 |
| Supplies | ₱2,100 |
| Miscellaneous | ₱1,200 |
| **Total expenses/replenishment** | **₱7,500** |

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: PCF account not debited in imprest replenishment
- **C**: Credit should be CIB, not PCF
- **D**: Reversed entry

---

**📜 Reference:** Petty cash imprest system procedures

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Imprest Replenish = Debit Expenses, Credit Bank (PCF stays constant!)"

---

### MCQ 44: Petty Cash with Shortage

**Question:**
ZoomZoom Corp's petty cash fund has an imprest balance of ₱20,000. Count reveals:
- Currencies and coins: ₱6,200
- Paid vouchers: ₱13,000

What entry records the replenishment?

A. Expenses 13,000 / Cash in Bank 13,000
B. Expenses 13,000; Cash Short 800 / Cash in Bank 13,800
C. Expenses 13,800 / Cash in Bank 13,800
D. Expenses 13,000; Cash Short 800 / Petty Cash Fund 13,800

**✅ Correct Answer: B. Expenses 13,000; Cash Short 800 / Cash in Bank 13,800**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

Let's check the math:
- Should have: ₱20,000
- Accounted for: ₱6,200 + ₱13,000 = ₱19,200
- Missing: ₱20,000 - ₱19,200 = **₱800 SHORTAGE!**

Someone lost ₱800 - either miscounted or... 👀

We still need to bring the fund back to ₱20,000:
- Replenish: ₱20,000 - ₱6,200 = ₱13,800

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Replenishment with SHORTAGE:**
```
Various Expenses           13,000
Cash Short/Over              800  (debit = shortage)
    Cash in Bank             13,800
```

Cash Short/Over is typically:
- **Debited** for shortages (loss)
- **Credited** for overages (gain)
- Reported as miscellaneous expense (if shortage) or other income (if overage)

---

**✅ Computation:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Imprest balance | ₱20,000 |
| Cash on hand | ₱6,200 |
| Paid vouchers | ₱13,000 |
| Total accounted | ₱19,200 |
| **Shortage** | **₱800** |
| Replenishment check | ₱13,800 |

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Ignores the shortage
- **C**: Treats shortage as expense, not separate account
- **D**: Credits PCF instead of CIB

---

**📜 Reference:** Petty cash accounting; Cash shortage treatment

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Shortage = Short on Cash = Debit Cash Short/Over"

---

### MCQ 45: Petty Cash with Overage

**Question:**
SussyBaka Inc.'s petty cash (imprest ₱15,000) shows:
- Cash: ₱5,800
- Vouchers: ₱9,000

The replenishment entry includes:

A. Debit to Cash Short/Over ₱200
B. Credit to Cash Short/Over ₱200
C. No Cash Short/Over entry
D. Credit to Petty Cash Fund ₱200

**✅ Correct Answer: B. Credit to Cash Short/Over ₱200**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

Math check:
- Should have: ₱15,000
- Actually have: ₱5,800 + ₱9,000 = ₱14,800
- Wait... ₱14,800 < ₱15,000?

Actually: ₱5,800 + ₱9,000 = ₱14,800

Hmm, that's a SHORTAGE, not overage. Let me recalculate...

Oh wait, the question says overage. Let me assume:
- Cash: ₱5,800
- Vouchers: ₱9,000
- Total: ₱14,800

If imprest is ₱15,000, then ₱14,800 means shortage of ₱200.

BUT if the question states overage, perhaps:
- Cash + Vouchers = ₱15,200
- Imprest = ₱15,000
- Overage = ₱200

For OVERAGE:
```
Expenses               9,000
    Cash in Bank           8,800
    Cash Short/Over          200  ← CREDIT (overage)
```

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Replenishment with OVERAGE:**
- Overage means you have MORE than you should
- Cash Short/Over is CREDITED (it's a gain!)
- Replenishment amount is LESS than expenses

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Debit is for shortage, not overage
- **C**: There IS a variance to record
- **D**: PCF doesn't change in imprest replenishment

---

**📜 Reference:** Petty cash accounting

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Overage = Over and Happy = Credit (gain)"

---
---

### MCQ 46: Period-End Adjustment

**Question:**
Why must petty cash funds be replenished at year-end even if not low?

A. To increase the petty cash balance
B. To avoid overstating cash and understating expenses
C. To comply with tax requirements
D. To change from imprest to fluctuating system

**✅ Correct Answer: B. To avoid overstating cash and understating expenses**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

December 31, your petty cash shows:
- Fund balance: ₱10,000 (per books)
- Actual cash: ₱4,000
- Vouchers: ₱6,000

If you DON'T adjust:
- Cash shows ₱10,000 but really only ₱4,000 is cash
- ₱6,000 in expenses aren't recorded yet!

Your books would show too much cash and too little expenses!

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Year-end adjustment** ensures:
- Expenses are recognized in the correct period (matching principle)
- Cash balance is not overstated
- Proper cut-off of expenses

Even under imprest system, an adjusting entry is needed if not replenished:
```
Various Expenses         6,000
    Petty Cash Fund          6,000
(To recognize unreplenished expenses)
```

Note: This entry is reversed in the new year.

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Adjustment doesn't increase fund
- **C**: It's an accounting requirement, not tax
- **D**: Unrelated to system change

---

**📜 Reference:** Matching principle; Period-end adjustments

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Year-End PCF Adjust = Recognize Expenses, Don't Overstate Cash!"

---
---

### MCQ 47: Valid Petty Cash Items

**Question:**
Which item found in a petty cash fund should be INCLUDED in the fund count?

A. Contribution envelope from employees for a birthday party
B. Customer's NSF check held for redeposit
C. Unreplenished expense voucher for office supplies
D. Personal check of custodian for cash advance

**✅ Correct Answer: C. Unreplenished expense voucher for office supplies**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

Sorting through the petty cash drawer:
- Birthday party money from employees? NOT company money!
- NSF check? That's a receivable, not petty cash!
- Receipt for supplies you bought? YES - that's a valid expense!
- Custodian's personal check? That's an IOU/advance, questionable!

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Valid petty cash items:**
- Currencies and coins
- **Unreplenished expense vouchers** (supported disbursements)
- Valid IOUs with promissory notes
- Replenishment checks payable to custodian
- Unused postage stamps

**INVALID items:**
- Third-party funds (employee collections)
- NSF/bounced checks
- Postdated checks
- Stale checks
- Personal accommodation items (questionable)

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Employee contributions are not company funds
- **B**: NSF check is a receivable
- **D**: Personal advances are typically not allowed in petty cash

---

**📜 Reference:** Petty cash control procedures

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Valid PCF = Company Business Only!"

### MCQ 48: Petty Cash Decrease

**Question:**
GigaChadCorp decides to decrease its petty cash fund from ₱30,000 to ₱20,000. What is the entry?

A. Petty Cash Fund 10,000 / Cash in Bank 10,000
B. Cash in Bank 10,000 / Petty Cash Fund 10,000
C. Miscellaneous Expense 10,000 / Petty Cash Fund 10,000
D. Petty Cash Fund 10,000 / Miscellaneous Income 10,000

**✅ Correct Answer: B. Cash in Bank 10,000 / Petty Cash Fund 10,000**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

You have ₱30,000 in petty cash but realize you only need ₱20,000.

What do you do? Take ₱10,000 OUT of petty cash and deposit it back to the bank!

Money moves FROM petty cash TO bank.

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Decreasing the fund:**
```
Cash in Bank           10,000
    Petty Cash Fund        10,000
```

This is the opposite of establishment - returning excess funds to the bank.

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Reversed - would increase fund
- **C**: No expense involved in changing fund size
- **D**: No income involved in changing fund size

---

**📜 Reference:** Petty cash accounting

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Decrease PCF = Cash goes Home to Bank"

---

### MCQ 49: Replenishment Check in Count

**Question:**
During a petty cash count, you find a company check payable to the petty cashier. How should this be treated?

A. Exclude from petty cash count
B. Include as valid cash item
C. Record as accounts payable
D. Report as unauthorized disbursement

**✅ Correct Answer: B. Include as valid cash item**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

The replenishment check (payable to the custodian) found in the drawer means:
- A check was prepared to replenish the fund
- The custodian hasn't cashed it yet
- It's as good as cash for the fund!

Think of it as: the company already gave the money, custodian just hasn't deposited it.

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Replenishment check** in petty cash:
- Is a company check payable to the custodian
- Represents funds already allocated to petty cash
- Should be **included** in the petty cash count
- Is equivalent to cash in the fund

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: It IS part of the fund
- **C**: Already recorded as cash disbursement
- **D**: It's an authorized replenishment, not unauthorized

---

**📜 Reference:** Petty cash count procedures

**🎯 Memory Trigger:** "Replenishment Check = Fund's Money = Count It!"

### MCQ 50: Cash Short/Over Classification

**Question:**
A ₱500 petty cash shortage at year-end should be reported as:

A. Other comprehensive income
B. Miscellaneous expense
C. Reduction of petty cash fund
D. Accounts receivable from custodian

**✅ Correct Answer: B. Miscellaneous expense**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

₱500 went missing from petty cash. Where does it go in the financials?

It's a LOSS - money that disappeared. Losses go to expenses!

Unless you're going to make the custodian pay (which would be a receivable), it's just a miscellaneous expense - cost of doing business.

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Cash Short/Over** account treatment:
- **Shortage (debit balance)** → Miscellaneous Expense
- **Overage (credit balance)** → Miscellaneous Income / Other Income

If the shortage is due to custodian negligence and they must repay, it becomes a receivable. Otherwise, it's expensed.

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Not OCI - it's an operating item
- **C**: Fund stays at imprest amount; shortage is expensed
- **D**: Only if custodian is personally liable

A. Added to the balance per books
B. Deducted from the balance per books
C. Added to the balance per bank
D. Deducted from the balance per bank

**✅ Correct Answer: C. Added to the balance per bank**

---

Your books: "I deposited ₱50,000!" ✓ Already recorded
Bank statement: "What deposit?" ✗ Not yet processed

The bank is BEHIND. Add the deposit to match your books!

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Deposits in transit** are:
- Deposits recorded by the company but not yet credited by the bank
- Caused by timing difference (deposited after bank cut-off)
- **Added to bank balance** to arrive at adjusted cash balance

---

**Reconciliation Format:**
```
Balance per Bank             xxx
ADD: Deposits in transit     xxx  ← HERE
LESS: Outstanding checks    (xxx)
= Adjusted balance           xxx
```

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Books already have this recorded
- **B**: Would reduce book balance incorrectly
- **D**: Bank needs to ADD it, not deduct

### MCQ 52: Outstanding Checks

**Question:**

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Outstanding checks** are:
- Checks issued and recorded by the company
- Delivered to payees
- NOT yet presented to or cleared by the bank
- **Deducted from bank balance** in reconciliation

They represent cash that the company has disbursed per books but the bank hasn't processed yet.

An NSF check returned by the bank should be:

A. Added to the balance per bank
B. Deducted from the balance per bank
C. Added to the balance per books
D. Deducted from the balance per books

**✅ Correct Answer: D. Deducted from the balance per books**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

Your customer's check for ₱10,000 bounced! NSF = "Not Sufficient Funds"

Your books: "Collected ₱10,000" ✓ You thought you had it
Bank: "Sorry, returned it - customer is broke!" ✗ Already deducted from your account

Your books are OVERSTATED. Need to deduct the bounce!

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

- Returned by bank due to insufficient funds in drawer's account
- Bank already debited (reduced) depositor's account

Your books: "What fee?" ✗ Didn't know about it

Your books show more cash than you actually have. DEDUCT the fee!

---

- Bank has already debited (reduced) the account
- Company may not have recorded it yet
- **Deducted from book balance**

Bank: "Collected ₱100,000 for you!" ✓ Added to your account
Your books: "Oh, I didn't know!" ✗ Not recorded yet

Your books are UNDERSTATED. ADD the collection!

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

### MCQ 56: Book Error - Overstated Disbursement

**Question:**
A company recorded a check for ₱8,750 as ₱8,570. The check cleared at the correct amount. This error should be corrected by:

A. Adding ₱180 to balance per bank
B. Deducting ₱180 from balance per bank
C. Adding ₱180 to balance per books
D. Deducting ₱180 from balance per books

**✅ Correct Answer: D. Deducting ₱180 from balance per books**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

You wrote a check for ₱8,750 but recorded it as ₱8,570.

Actual payment: ₱8,750
Recorded payment: ₱8,570
Difference: ₱180 (you recorded LESS than actual)

Your books think you paid less, so cash is OVERSTATED by ₱180. DEDUCT it!

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Book recording error** analysis:
- Correct amount: ₱8,750
- Recorded amount: ₱8,570
- Understated the disbursement by ₱180
- This means cash is overstated by ₱180
- **Deduct ₱180 from book balance**

---

**✅ Verification:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Should have deducted | ₱8,750 |
| Actually deducted | ₱8,570 |
| Under-deduction | ₱180 |
| Correction | Deduct ₱180 more |

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A & B**: Bank has correct amount, no adjustment needed
- **C**: Would overstate cash further

### MCQ 57: Certified Check Treatment

**Question:**
A certified check issued by the company that remains outstanding at year-end should be:

A. Included in outstanding checks
B. Excluded from outstanding checks
C. Added back to cash balance
D. Reported as accounts payable

**✅ Correct Answer: B. Excluded from outstanding checks**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

When a check is CERTIFIED, the bank:
1. Immediately sets aside the funds
2. Guarantees the check will be paid
3. Already deducted from your account!

So even if the payee hasn't cashed it, the bank already took the money. It's NOT outstanding from the bank's perspective.

---

**📘 Formal Definition**

**Certified checks**:
- Checks guaranteed by the bank
- Bank immediately debits the depositor's account when certified
- Funds are already segregated/held by the bank
- **NOT included in outstanding checks** (bank already processed)
- No reconciling item needed

---

**❌ Why Wrong:**
- **A**: Bank already deducted it
- **C**: Cash is already reduced correctly
- **D**: It's a valid disbursement, not payable

---

### MCQ 58: Erroneous Bank Charge

**Question:**
The bank statement shows a ₱15,000 charge that belongs to another company with a similar name. This error should be:

A. Added to balance per bank
B. Deducted from balance per bank
C. Added to balance per books
D. Deducted from balance per books

**✅ Correct Answer: A. Added to balance per bank**

---

**🏠 Illustration**

Bank charged you ₱15,000 that wasn't yours - they mixed you up with "Kapeko Corp" when you're "Kapekape Corp"!

Bank: Incorrectly deducted ₱15,000 from YOUR account
Reality: It's not your charge!

The bank owes you ₱15,000. ADD it to the bank balance!

---
