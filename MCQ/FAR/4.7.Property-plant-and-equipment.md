## 2. REVIEW NOTES

### 2.1 PPE Definition & Characteristics

**Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE)** are characterized by:

1. **Tangible assets** – items of PPE have physical substance
2. **Used in normal operations** – items of PPE are either used in production or supply of goods or services, for rental (if not land or building), for administrative purposes or for selling goods
3. **Long-term asset** – items of PPE are expected to be used for more than a year

### 2.2 Initial Measurement Framework

Initially, PPE are measured at cost, composed of:

1. **Purchase price**, including import duties and nonrefundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates (a.k.a. cost to acquire from seller)
2. **Cost directly attributable** to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management
3. **Initial estimate of the cost** of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs

### 2.3 Cost Measurement by Acquisition Mode

| Mode | Measurement of Cost to Acquire |
|------|------------------------------|
| **Cash Basis** | Cash paid (face value) - Cash discount (taken or not) = Cash price (cost) |
| **On Account** | List price - Trade discount = Invoice price |
| **Issuance of Notes (Deferred Payment)** | Priority 1 – Cash Price<br>Priority 2 – Fair value of the note issued + Downpayment = Cost |
| **Issuance of Shares** | Priority 1 – Fair value of PPE received<br>Priority 2 – Fair value of shares given up + Cash paid = Cost<br>Priority 3 – Par value of shares given up + Cash paid = Cost |
| **Exchange or Trade-in** | WITH COMMERCIAL SUBSTANCE:<br>Priority 1: FV of PPE given up (old) + Cash paid - Cash received = Cost<br>Priority 2: FV of PPE received (new)<br>Priority 3: CA of PPE given up (old) + Cash paid - Cash received = Cost<br><br>WITHOUT COMMERCIAL SUBSTANCE:<br>CA of PPE given up (old) + Cash paid - Cash received = Cost |
| **Lump Sum Acquisition** | Priority 1 – Relative FV method (FV of all PPE is available)<br>Purchase price of group × (FV of single PPE ÷ FV of all PPE in the group) = Cost<br><br>Priority 2 – Residual method (FV of one PPE is not available)<br>Purchase price of group - FV of PPE with FV (cost) = Cost of PPE w/o FV<br><br>Priority 3 – Allocated 100% to land (No FV available) |
| **Donation** | Cost – Fair value of PPE received |
| **Construction** | Capitalized costs include: demolishing old building, cost to vacate, raw materials, direct labor, overhead, construction cost, excavation, temporary structures, supervision, inspection fees, building permit, insurance during construction, architect fees, other improvements, borrowing costs |

### 2.4 Note Issuance Details

## FAR.118 — PPE DEPRECIATION & DISPOSAL

### 1. LEARNING OBJECTIVES

#### 1.1 Depreciation Methods
To compute depreciation using the following methods under different scenarios:

a. Straight-line method
b. Sum-of-years' digit
c. Double and 150% declining balance
d. Output method
e. Depreciation of leasehold improvement
f. Depreciation with change in cost and/or estimates
g. Composite method
h. Retirement method
i. Replacement method
j. Inventory method

#### 1.2 Disposal Calculations
To compute gain and loss from disposal of property, plant and equipment

### 2. REVIEW NOTES

#### 2.1 Depreciation Fundamentals

**Depreciation** is systematic allocation of depreciable amount of an asset over its estimated useful life. Depreciation is cost allocation rather than asset valuation.

**Depreciation begins** when it is available for use and **depreciation ceases** when asset is derecognized. Even if asset is not being used or idle, depreciation continues.

**Characteristics of Property, Plant and Equipment:**

1. **Tangible assets** – items of PPE have physical substance
2. **Used in normal operations** – items of PPE are either used in production or supply of goods or services, for rental (if not land or building), for administrative purposes or for selling goods
3. **Long-term asset** – items of PPE are expected to be used for more than a year

#### 2.2 Depreciation Methods

##### Straight-Line Depreciation Method

Annual depreciation charges are equal over the number of years of estimated useful life.

The principle in straight-line method considers depreciation as a function of time rather than as a function of usage.

| Formula |
|----------|
| Cost – Residual value = Depreciation<br>Estimated useful life |

**Residual value (RV)** = Estimated selling price after useful life less cost to sell.

##### Accelerated Depreciation Method

Provides higher depreciation in earlier years and lower depreciation in later years of useful life of asset.

There are three accelerated depreciation methods:

1. **Sum-of-years' digit method**
2. **Double declining balance method**
3. **150% declining balance method**

The principle under accelerated depreciation is that new assets are generally more efficient during earlier years than in later years.

##### Sum-of-years' Digit Method

Depreciation under this method is computed as follows:

| Formula |
|----------|
| Cost – RV × Useful life – Age ÷ Summation of digits<br>in useful life = Depreciation Exp. |

##### Double Declining Balance Method

Depreciation under this method is computed as follows:

| Cost | XX |
|------|----|
| Less: Accumulated depreciation – beg. (XX) | |
| **Carrying amount** | XX |
| Times: Depreciation rate | X% |
| **Depreciation expense** | XX |

**Residual value** will be considered only in the last year of useful life.

While **depreciation rate** is computed as:

| Formula |
|----------|
| 2 ÷ Estimated useful life = Depreciation Rate |

##### Variable Charge or Activity Method

The variable or activity methods assume that depreciation is more a function of use rather than passage of time. There are two variable methods:

1. **Working hours method**
2. **Output or production method**

**Working Hours and Output Method**

Depreciation under this method is computed as follows:

| Formula |
|----------|
| Cost – RV × Actual output/hours During year ÷ Total estimated<br>output/hours over useful life = Depreciation Exp. |

#### 2.3 Changes in Depreciation Estimates

A new depreciation expense should be computed if any of the following is present:

a. Change (additional) in capitalized cost
b. Change in estimated useful life
c. Change in residual value
d. Change in depreciation method
e. Impairment loss
f. Revaluation surplus

##### Computation of New Depreciation

**Step 1:** Compute carrying amount on date of change in estimate:

| Original cost | XX |
|------------|----|
| Less: Accumulated depreciation | (XX) |
| Less: Accumulated impairment | (XX) |
| Add: Additional capital expenditure | XX |
| **Carrying amount – change in est.** | XX |

**Step 2:** Apply changes and use carrying amount on date of change as new basis of depreciation:

| Carrying amount at date of change in est. – New residual value = Depreciation Exp.<br>New estimated remaining useful life |

#### 2.4 Capital Expenditure and Revenue Expenditure

**Revenue expenditure** are expenditure that will only benefit current period. This cost is reported as an expense.

**Capital expenditure** are expenditure that will benefit current period and future period. This cost is capitalized and reported as an asset. Cost will benefit future periods when:

- It extends the life of the property
- It increases the capacity of the property
- Improves the efficiency and safety of the property

**Summary of treatment to expenditures:**

| Type | Treatment |
|------|-----------|
| Additions – capitalize |
| Improvement or betterment – capitalize |
| Replacement – capitalize |
| Extraordinary repair – capitalize |
| Ordinary repair – expense |
| Rearrangement cost – expense |

#### 2.5 Special Depreciation Methods

##### Composite and Group Depreciation

This depreciation method computes a single depreciation amount for depreciation of many individual assets.

**Composite life:**

| Formula |
|----------|
| Cost – Residual value ÷ Composite life = Annual depreciation of the group |

**Composite rate:**

| Formula |
|----------|
| Annual depreciation of the group = Composite rate × Cost |

##### Subsequent Depreciation Under Composite Method

The composite rate is only computed once and that rate will be used in subsequent year even if there was an acquisition or disposal.

The subsequent depreciation expense using the composite method is computed as follows:

| Original cost of the group | XX |
|---------------------------|----|
| Add: Cost of newly acquired PPE | XX |
| Less: Cost of retired PPE | (XX) |
| **Updated cost** | XX |
| Times: Composite rate | X% |
| **Depreciation expense** | XX |

##### Disposal of PPE Under Composite Method

No gain or loss are recognized when a PPE is sold under the composite method. The accumulated depreciation of PPE sold is computed as follows:

| Cost | XX |
|------|----|
| Times: Selling price of PPE sold | X% |
| **Accumulated depreciation** | XX |

##### Retirement Method

Depreciation under this method is computed as follows:

| Cost of sold PPE | XX |
|-----------------|----|
| Less: Selling price of PPE sold | (XX) |
| **Depreciation expense for the year** | XX |

##### Replacement Method

Depreciation under this method is computed as follows:

| Acquisition cost of new PPE to<br>replace PPE sold | XX |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| Less: Selling price of PPE sold | (XX) |
| **Depreciation expense for the year** | XX |

##### Inventory Method

Depreciation under this method is computed as follows:

| Specific PPE account (e.g., tools) |
|------------------------------|
| Tools – beg. | XX |
| Cost of new acquisition | XX |
| Selling price – sold | XX |
| **Depreciation (squeeze)** | XX |
| Tools – end | XX |

#### 2.6 Gain or Loss on Disposal of PPE

**Step 1:** Compute the carrying amount on the date of disposal.

| Cost | XX |
|------|----|
| Less: Accumulated depreciation | (XX) |
| **Carrying amount on sale** | XX |

**Step 2:** Compute the gain or loss on sale

| Net selling price | XX |
|-----------------|----|
| Less: Carrying amount on sale | (XX) |
| **Gain or (loss) on sale** | XX |

## FAR.119 — REVALUATION MODELS

### 1. LEARNING OBJECTIVES

#### 1.1 Revaluation Calculations
1. To compute for the "whole" revaluation surplus
2. To compute for the "remaining" revaluation surplus
3. To compute for new depreciation expense
4. To account for revaluation of asset that was previously impaired
5. To account for impairment of asset that was previously revalued

### 2. REVIEW NOTES

#### 2.1 Revaluation Model Overview

**Revaluation Model** – The PPE are measured subsequently at revalued amount. This is fair value less subsequent depreciation and impairment. If a company used the revaluation model on an item of PPE, the entire class of PPE to which that asset belongs shall be revalued.

#### 2.2 Cost Model vs Revaluation Model

| Increase in Value of Asset | Cost Model | Revaluation Model |
|--------------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Without prior impairment | Do not recognize | Recognize as "revaluation surplus" (RS) |
| With prior impairment | Recognize as "Gain on reversal" | Recognize as "Gain on reversal"<br>And revaluation surplus" |

| Decrease in Value of Asset | Cost Model | Revaluation Model |
|--------------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Without prior revaluation | Recognize as "Impairment loss" | Recognize as "Impairment loss" |
| With prior revaluation | Not applicable | Recognize as "Deduction to RS and<br>Impairment loss" |

#### 2.3 Revaluation Calculations

##### Whole Revaluation Surplus (date of revaluation):

| Revalued - FV/SV/DRC (a) | XX |
| Less: Carrying amount (b) | (XX) |
| **Whole revaluation surplus** | XX |

**Note:** If "fair value" is given, no more computation is needed, however, if "replacement cost" is given, DRC is computed as follows:

| Replacement cost (RC) | XX |
|---------------------|----|
| Less: Acc. Dep [(RC/life) * age] | (XX) |
| **Depreciated replacement cost** | XX |

**Carrying amount:**

| Cost | XX |
|------|----|
| Less: Acc. Dep [(Cost/life) * age] | (XX) |
| **Carrying amount** | XX |

##### Remaining Revaluation Surplus (subsequent to date of revaluation):

| Whole revaluation surplus (see above) | XX |
|----------------------------------|----|
| Less: Amount transferred to R.E. (a) | (XX) |
| **Remaining revaluation surplus** | XX |

##### Amount Transferred to Retained Earnings:

**(For depreciable asset)**
| Formula |
|----------|
| Whole revaluation surplus ÷ Annual transfer × Remaining useful life |

**(For non-depreciable asset)**
| Formula |
|----------|
| 100% when revalued asset is sold, 0% if not sold. |

#### 2.4 Special Scenarios

##### Impairment of Previously Revalued Asset

Decrease in value is recognize as deduction to the remaining revaluation surplus and balance is treated as impairment loss.

**COMPUTATION:**

| Carrying amount on impairment (a) | XX |
|-------------------------------|----|
| Less: Recoverable amount (b) | (XX) |
| **Total loss** | XX |
| Less: Remaining revaluation sur. (c) | (XX) |
| **Impairment loss** | XX |

**Carrying amount:**
| Carrying amount on revaluation (FV/SV/DRC) | XX |
|------------------------------------------|----|
| Less: New depreciation | (XX) |
| **Carrying amount on impairment** | XX |

**Recoverable amount:**
| Fair value less cost to sell | XX |
|------------------------------|----|
| Versus: Value-in-use | XX |
| **Recoverable amount (select higher)** | XX |
