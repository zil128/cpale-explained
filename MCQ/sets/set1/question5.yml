    correct: true
    label: Other non-current asset

    label: Current liability

explanation:
  short: Legally restricted compensating balances for long-term loans are classified as other non-current assets.
  long: |
    Compensating balances are minimum deposits required to be maintained as collateral for loans. Their presentation depends on legal restrictions and loan terms:
    
    COMPENSATING BALANCE CLASSIFICATION:
    
    1. NOT LEGALLY RESTRICTED:
       - Included in cash and cash equivalents
    
    2. LEGALLY RESTRICTED:
       - Related to SHORT-TERM loan → Other CURRENT asset (separate from cash)
       - Related to LONG-TERM loan → Other NON-CURRENT asset (separate from cash)
    
    ACCOUNTING TREATMENT:
    - The ₱200,000 compensating balance cannot be used for other purposes
    - It serves as collateral for the ₱2,000,000 long-term loan
    - Since the loan is long-term and the balance is legally restricted, it's classified as non-current
    - It's disclosed separately from cash and cash equivalents
    
    KEY PRINCIPLE: Match the classification of the compensating balance with the classification of the related loan.
tip: Think "MATCH THE LOAN TERM" - short-term loan = current asset, long-term loan = non-current asset.
