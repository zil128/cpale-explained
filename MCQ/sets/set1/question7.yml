    PETTY CASH REPLENISHMENT UNDER IMPREST SYSTEM:
    
    STEP 1: Calculate total expenses to be recorded
    Office supplies: ₱2,500
    Transportation: ₱800
    Postage: ₱600
    Total expenses: ₱3,900
    
    STEP 2: Verify fund balance
    Original fund: ₱5,000
    Cash remaining: ₱1,000
    Receipts: ₱3,900
    Total: ₱4,900
    
    SHORTAGE: ₱100 (₱5,000 - ₱4,900)
    
    STEP 3: Journal entry for replenishment
    Debit: Office supplies ₱2,500
    Debit: Transportation ₱800
    Debit: Postage ₱600
    Debit: Cash short/over ₱100 (for shortage)
    Credit: Cash ₱4,000
    
    CORRECTED ANSWER: Since the question shows expenses total ₱3,900 (₱2,500 + ₱800 + ₱600), the replenishment amount should be ₱3,900. The ₱1,000 cash remaining plus ₱3,900 in receipts equals ₱4,900, indicating a ₱100 shortage.
    
    KEY PRINCIPLE: Under imprest system, only expense accounts are debited and cash is credited when replenishing. The Petty Cash account itself is only affected during establishment or fund size changes.
tip: Replenishment restores the fund to its original amount - record the expenses spent.
