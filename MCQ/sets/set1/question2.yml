    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE:
    - Equity instruments (shares of stocks)
    - Debt instruments (government securities, corporate bonds)
    - Derivatives (cross currency swaps, options, futures)
    
    NOT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:
    - Income taxes - statutory obligations imposed by law, not contracts
    - Physical assets like inventory, property, plant and equipment
    - Prepaid expenses
    
    KEY DISTINCTION: Financial instruments arise from CONTRACTS between parties, while income taxes arise from legal requirements imposed by government.
tip: Think "CONTRACT" when identifying financial instruments - no contract = not a financial instrument.
