access-level: FREE
topic: Cash and Cash Equivalents
choices:
  choice1:
    label: Readily convertible to a known amount of cash
    why-wrong-choice: This is a requirement - cash equivalents must be easily convertible to cash.
  choice2:
    label: Subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value
    why-wrong-choice: This is a requirement - cash equivalents must have minimal value risk.
  choice3:
    label: A short maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition
    why-wrong-choice: This is a requirement - the 3-month rule applies from acquisition to maturity.
  choice4:
    correct: true
    label: Equity investments
explanation:
  short: Equity investments are never cash equivalents because they have significant value risk and no maturity date.
  long: |
    PAS 7 defines cash equivalents as short-term, highly liquid investments that are:
    
    1. READILY CONVERTIBLE to known amounts of cash
    2. Subject to INSIGNIFICANT RISK of changes in value
    3. Have SHORT MATURITY (three months or less from acquisition date)
    
    EXAMPLES OF CASH EQUIVALENTS:
    - Treasury bills due within 3 months
    - Commercial paper maturing within 3 months
    - Time deposits with 3-month maturity
    - Preference shares with specified redemption date within 3 months
    
    NEVER CASH EQUIVALENTS:
    - Equity investments (common shares, preferred shares without redemption date)
    - Investments with significant value risk
    - Investments with maturity exceeding 3 months
    
    KEY POINT: Equity investments inherently have significant value risk due to market fluctuations and no guaranteed redemption value, making them ineligible as cash equivalents.
tip: Think "SAFE and SHORT" - if it has market risk or matures beyond 3 months, it's not a cash equivalent.
