choices:
  choice1:
    label: ₱100,000
    why-wrong-choice: This is the book balance before adjustments. NSF check and bank service charge must be deducted from books.
  choice2:
    label: ₱104,000
    why-wrong-choice: This incorrectly adds outstanding checks and deposits in transit to the book balance without making necessary adjustments.
  choice3:
    label: ₱96,000
    why-wrong-choice: This only considers NSF check and service charge but ignores the book balance reconciliation.
  choice4:
    correct: true
    label: ₱97,500
explanation:
  short: The correct cash balance is ₱97,500, derived from adjusting the book balance for NSF check and bank service charge.

    BANK RECONCILIATION PROCESS:
    
    STEP 1: Adjust BOOK BALANCE to CORRECTED BOOK BALANCE
    Starting book balance: ₱100,000
    Less: NSF check: (₱2,000) - Customer's check bounced
    Less: Bank service charge: (₱500) - Bank fee not yet recorded
    CORRECTED BOOK BALANCE: ₱97,500
    
    STEP 2: Verify with BANK BALANCE adjustments
    Bank balance would be adjusted by:
    Add: Deposits in transit: ₱12,000
    Less: Outstanding checks: (₱8,000)
    
    KEY POINT: Only items that affect the company's books (NSF checks, bank charges, errors) change the cash balance reported on financial statements.
    
    ITEMS THAT DON'T CHANGE REPORTED CASH:
    - Outstanding checks (already recorded in books)
    - Deposits in transit (already recorded in books)
    
    ITEMS THAT CHANGE REPORTED CASH:
    - NSF checks (reduce cash, increase receivables)
    - Bank service charges (reduce cash, increase expenses)
    - Bank errors (require adjustment)
tip: Book adjustments change your cash balance; bank timing differences don't.
