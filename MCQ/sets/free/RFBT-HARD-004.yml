choices:
  choice1:
    label: "Issued shares increase to 66,000; no change in total stockholders' equity"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "Issued shares increase to 66,000; total stockholders' equity increases by PHP 600,000"
    why-wrong-choice: "Stock dividends do not increase total equity; they merely transfer from retained earnings to capital stock (equity reclassification)"
  choice3:
    label: "Authorized shares must first be increased before stock dividends can be declared"
    why-wrong-choice: "There are 40,000 unissued shares available (100,000 - 60,000); 6,000 new shares needed for 10% dividend can be issued"
  choice4:
    label: "Issued shares increase to 70,000; retained earnings decrease by PHP 1,000,000"
    why-wrong-choice: "10% of 60,000 shares = 6,000 new shares (not 10,000); RE decreases by 6,000 x PHP 100 = PHP 600,000"
explanation:
  short: "Stock dividends: 10% of 60,000 = 6,000 new shares. RE decreases PHP 600,000, capital stock increases PHP 600,000. Total equity unchanged."

    STOCK DIVIDENDS UNDER CORPORATION CODE AND SEC RULES:

    EFFECT OF STOCK DIVIDENDS:
    Stock dividends are distributions of additional shares to existing stockholders. They result in:
    1. Transfer from Retained Earnings to Capital Stock
    2. NO change in Total Stockholders' Equity
    3. NO distribution of corporate assets

    CALCULATION:

    Before Stock Dividend:
    - Issued shares: 60,000
    - Par value: PHP 100
    - Capital Stock: PHP 6,000,000
    - Unrestricted RE: PHP 800,000

    Stock Dividend Declaration:
    - Rate: 10%
    - New shares: 60,000 x 10% = 6,000 shares
    - Amount transferred: 6,000 x PHP 100 = PHP 600,000

    After Stock Dividend:
    - Issued shares: 66,000 (60,000 + 6,000)
    - Capital Stock: PHP 6,600,000 (+PHP 600,000)
    - Unrestricted RE: PHP 200,000 (-PHP 600,000)
    - Total SE: UNCHANGED

    LEGAL REQUIREMENTS (Sec. 42, RCC):
    1. Approval by board of directors
    2. Approval by 2/3 of outstanding capital stock
    3. Sufficient unrestricted retained earnings (PHP 800,000 > PHP 600,000 ✓)
    4. Sufficient unissued authorized shares (40,000 > 6,000 ✓)
tip: "Stock dividends = equity RECLASSIFICATION only. Total SE stays same. Check: sufficient RE AND authorized but unissued shares."
