    PFRS 10 DEFINITION OF CONTROL

    An investor CONTROLS an investee when it has ALL THREE elements:

    1. POWER over the investee
       - Existing rights that give ability to direct RELEVANT ACTIVITIES
       - Relevant activities = activities that significantly affect investee's returns
       - Can have power through voting rights, contractual arrangements, etc.

    2. EXPOSURE OR RIGHTS TO VARIABLE RETURNS
       - Returns that vary based on investee's performance
       - Can be positive (dividends, synergies) or negative (losses)

    3. ABILITY TO USE POWER TO AFFECT RETURNS
       - Link between power and returns
       - Investor uses power to influence its returns

    WHY LEGAL OWNERSHIP IS NOT A FACTOR:
    - Control is based on SUBSTANCE over form
    - An entity can control with less than 50% (e.g., dispersed ownership, contractual rights)
    - An entity may NOT control even with more than 50% (e.g., substantive participation rights)
    - Potential voting rights, options, and de facto control must be considered

    EXAMPLES OF CONTROL WITHOUT MAJORITY:
    - Largest shareholder in widely dispersed ownership
    - Contractual control through board composition
    - Power through options or convertible instruments
tip: "Control = Power + Variable Returns + Link. Ownership % is evidence, not conclusive."
reference: "PFRS 10, Paragraphs 5-9"
