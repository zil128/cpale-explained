choices:
  choice1:
    label: "Deferred tax assets arising from the acquisition"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "Identifiable intangible assets acquired"
    why-wrong-choice: "PFRS 3.18 requires identifiable intangible assets to be measured at fair value"
  choice3:
    label: "Contingent liabilities assumed"
    why-wrong-choice: "PFRS 3.23 requires contingent liabilities to be recognized at fair value if present obligation"
  choice4:
    label: "Non-controlling interest (full goodwill method)"
    why-wrong-choice: "Under full goodwill method, NCI is measured at fair value (PFRS 3.19)"
explanation:
  short: "Deferred taxes follow PAS 12, not fair value measurement. They're calculated based on temporary differences arising from fair value adjustments."

    Under PFRS 3 'Business Combinations', most identifiable assets and liabilities are measured at FAIR VALUE on the acquisition date. However, there are EXCEPTIONS:

    EXCEPTIONS TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT:

    1. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS/LIABILITIES (PAS 12)
       - Measured under PAS 12 based on temporary differences
       - Arise from difference between tax base and fair value of assets/liabilities
       - NOT discounted

    2. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (PAS 19)
       - Measured under PAS 19 for defined benefit obligations

    3. SHARE-BASED PAYMENT (PFRS 2)
       - Replacement awards measured under PFRS 2

    4. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE (PFRS 5)
       - Measured at fair value less costs to sell under PFRS 5

    5. INDEMNIFICATION ASSETS
       - Measured consistently with indemnified item

    EXAMPLE: Acquiree's building has:
    - Carrying amount: PHP 10M (also tax base)
    - Fair value: PHP 15M
    - Temporary difference: PHP 5M
    - Deferred tax liability: PHP 5M × 25% = PHP 1.25M (not at fair value)
tip: "Deferred taxes = PAS 12 measurement, NOT fair value. Calculate from temporary differences."
