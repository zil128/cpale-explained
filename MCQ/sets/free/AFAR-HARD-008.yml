    EQUITY METHOD ACCOUNTING (PAS 28)

    INITIAL RECOGNITION:
    - Investment recorded at COST: PHP 5,000,000
    - Note: Cost (5M) = 30% of FV of net assets (4.5M) + Implied goodwill (0.5M)

    SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT:
    - Add: Share of associate's net income
    - Deduct: Share of dividends received
    - Add/Deduct: Share of OCI, amortization of excess FV allocations, impairment

    CALCULATION:

    Beginning investment:                    PHP 5,000,000
    Add: Share of net income (30% × 2M):    PHP   600,000
    Less: Share of dividends (30% × 500K): (PHP   150,000)
    Ending investment:                       PHP 5,450,000

    JOURNAL ENTRIES:
    
    Share of net income:
    Dr. Investment in Associate      600,000
        Cr. Investment Income                   600,000

    Dividends received:
    Dr. Cash                         150,000
        Cr. Investment in Associate             150,000

    KEY: Dividends REDUCE the investment (not income) because they represent return OF investment, not return ON investment.
tip: "Equity method: + Share of Income, - Share of Dividends. Dividends reduce investment, not income!"
reference: "PAS 28, Paragraphs 10-14"
