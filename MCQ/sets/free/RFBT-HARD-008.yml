    CASH DIVIDEND - KEY DATES AND CONCEPTS:

    THREE IMPORTANT DATES:

    1. DECLARATION DATE (December 1, 2025):
       - Board of Directors declares dividend
       - DIVIDEND LIABILITY ARISES
       - Retained Earnings is debited, Dividends Payable is credited
       - This is when corporation becomes legally obligated

    2. RECORD DATE (December 15, 2025):
       - Determines WHO receives the dividend
       - Stockholders on this date are entitled to dividend
       - Stock transfers after this date don't transfer dividend rights

    3. PAYMENT DATE (January 15, 2026):
       - Actual distribution of cash to stockholders
       - Dividends Payable is debited, Cash is credited

    APPLICATION TO THE CASE:

    Timeline:
    - Dec 1: Declaration (liability arises)
    - Dec 10: A sells to B
    - Dec 15: Record date (B is stockholder of record)
    - Jan 15: Payment date

    ANALYSIS:
    - When were shares sold? December 10 (BEFORE record date)
    - Who owned shares on record date? B
    - Who receives dividend? B

    The sale on December 10 transferred ALL rights attached to the shares, including the right to receive the declared dividend, because the sale occurred BEFORE the record date.

    When did liability arise? December 1 (declaration date) - this is when the corporation's obligation became fixed.
tip: "Dividend rights follow the RECORD DATE holder. Liability arises on DECLARATION DATE."
