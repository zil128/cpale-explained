    GOING CONCERN REPORTING (PSA 570)

    SCENARIO MATRIX:

    1. MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY EXISTS, ADEQUATE DISCLOSURE
       - Opinion: UNMODIFIED
       - Add: EMPHASIS OF MATTER paragraph
       - Heading: "Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern"
       - Draw attention to disclosure in notes

    2. MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY EXISTS, INADEQUATE DISCLOSURE
       - Opinion: QUALIFIED or ADVERSE (depending on severity)
       - Reason: Inadequate disclosure is a departure from framework

    3. USE OF GOING CONCERN BASIS NOT APPROPRIATE
       - Opinion: ADVERSE
       - Management preparing going concern FS when liquidation is certain

    4. MANAGEMENT UNWILLING TO MAKE ASSESSMENT
       - Consider: Qualified or disclaimer for scope limitation

    EMPHASIS OF MATTER REQUIREMENTS:
    - Placed immediately after the Opinion section
    - Heading: "Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern"
    - Reference to the note disclosure
    - Statement that "our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter"

    KEY: Emphasis of Matter draws attention but does NOT modify the opinion. It is for significant matters that are properly disclosed.
tip: "Going concern + Adequate disclosure = Emphasis of Matter (opinion NOT modified)"
reference: "PSA 570, Paragraphs 22-23"
