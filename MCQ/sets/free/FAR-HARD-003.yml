text: "Company X acquired a building for PHP 10,000,000 on January 1, 2023. The building has a useful life of 20 years. On December 31, 2024, the building's fair value is PHP 11,500,000. If Company X uses the revaluation model under PAS 16, what is the revaluation surplus to be recognized?"

  choice1:
    label: "PHP 2,500,000"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "PHP 1,500,000"
    why-wrong-choice: "This ignores accumulated depreciation; you must compare fair value to carrying amount, not original cost"
  choice3:
    label: "PHP 2,000,000"
    why-wrong-choice: "Incorrect calculation; the carrying amount after 2 years of depreciation is PHP 9,000,000"
  choice4:
    label: "PHP 11,500,000"
    why-wrong-choice: "This is the fair value, not the revaluation surplus; surplus = FV minus carrying amount"
explanation:
  short: "Revaluation surplus = Fair Value minus Carrying Amount. Don't forget to deduct accumulated depreciation first!"

    CALCULATION OF REVALUATION SURPLUS:

    Step 1: Calculate Carrying Amount at December 31, 2024
    - Original cost: PHP 10,000,000
    - Annual depreciation: PHP 10,000,000 ÷ 20 years = PHP 500,000
    - Accumulated depreciation (2 years): PHP 500,000 × 2 = PHP 1,000,000
    - Carrying amount: PHP 10,000,000 - PHP 1,000,000 = PHP 9,000,000

    Step 2: Calculate Revaluation Surplus
    - Fair value: PHP 11,500,000
    - Carrying amount: PHP 9,000,000
    - Revaluation surplus: PHP 11,500,000 - PHP 9,000,000 = PHP 2,500,000

    JOURNAL ENTRY:
    Dr. Building                    2,500,000
    Dr. Accumulated Depreciation    1,000,000
        Cr. Building (gross up)                 1,000,000
        Cr. Revaluation Surplus (OCI)           2,500,000

    The revaluation surplus is recognized in OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME and accumulated in equity.
tip: "Revaluation Surplus = FV - Carrying Amount (remember to deduct accumulated depreciation!)"
reference: "PAS 16, Paragraphs 39-40"
