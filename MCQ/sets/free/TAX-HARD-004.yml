    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "PHP 60,000"
    why-wrong-choice: "This treats capital goods input VAT as non-creditable; capital goods input VAT is fully creditable"
  choice3:
    label: "PHP 240,000"
    why-wrong-choice: "This ignores all input VAT credits; input VAT reduces output VAT"
  choice4:

    VALUE-ADDED TAX COMPUTATION

    FORMULA:
    VAT Payable = Output VAT - Input VAT

    GIVEN:
    - Output VAT:                       PHP 240,000
    - Input VAT (capital goods):        PHP 180,000
    - Input VAT (purchases):            PHP 100,000
    - Total Input VAT:                  PHP 280,000

    COMPUTATION:
    - Output VAT:                       PHP 240,000
    - Less: Total Input VAT:           (PHP 280,000)
    - EXCESS INPUT VAT:                (PHP  40,000)

    TREATMENT OF EXCESS INPUT VAT:
    - Generally: Carried forward to succeeding quarters
    - May apply for refund/credit after 2 years from close of taxable quarter
    - For zero-rated/effectively zero-rated sales: May claim refund within 2 years

    INPUT VAT ON CAPITAL GOODS:
    - Fully creditable against output VAT
    - Capital goods = goods with useful life of more than one year
    - Must be used in VAT-taxable business

    NOTE: Unlike some jurisdictions, Philippine VAT allows immediate crediting of capital goods input VAT (no amortization requirement under current rules).
tip: "VAT = Output - Input. Excess input VAT = Carry forward (not immediate refund)"
