    AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES REGARDING FRAUD (PSA 240)

    AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITY:
    - Obtain REASONABLE ASSURANCE that financial statements are free from MATERIAL misstatement, whether due to fraud or error
    - Maintain professional skepticism
    - Assess risks of material misstatement due to fraud
    - Design and perform procedures responsive to assessed risks

    MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY:
    - Prevention and detection of fraud
    - Design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control
    - Fostering a culture of honesty and ethical behavior

    LIMITATIONS OF AN AUDIT:
    - Fraud often involves concealment, collusion, forgery
    - Management is in a position to override controls
    - Auditors cannot obtain ABSOLUTE assurance
    - Risk of not detecting material misstatement due to fraud is HIGHER than for error

    AUDITOR'S RESPONSE TO SUSPECTED FRAUD:
    1. Obtain additional audit evidence
    2. Consider implications for other aspects of audit
    3. Communicate to management and those charged with governance
    4. Consider reporting to regulatory authorities if required
tip: "Auditor = Reasonable assurance on MATERIAL fraud. Management = Prevent and detect ALL fraud."
