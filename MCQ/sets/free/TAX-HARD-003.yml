    ESTATE TAX UNDER TRAIN LAW

    For RESIDENT CITIZENS and RESIDENT ALIENS:
    - Gross estate includes WORLDWIDE properties (Phil + foreign)

    CALCULATION:

    Gross Estate:
    - Philippine properties:    PHP 15,000,000
    - Foreign properties:       PHP  5,000,000
    - Total Gross Estate:       PHP 20,000,000

    Less: Deductions
    - Expenses, losses, debts:  PHP  3,000,000
    - Standard deduction:       PHP  5,000,000
    - Total deductions:         PHP  8,000,000

    NET TAXABLE ESTATE:         PHP 12,000,000

    ESTATE TAX RATE (TRAIN Law):
    - Single rate: 6% of net estate in excess of PHP 5,000,000 standard deduction
    - Estate tax = (PHP 12,000,000) × 6% = PHP 720,000

    KEY CHANGES UNDER TRAIN LAW:
    1. Flat 6% rate (replaced graduated 5-20% rates)
    2. PHP 5,000,000 standard deduction (not itemized)
    3. Removed family home deduction, medical expenses, funeral expenses as separate items
    4. Share of surviving spouse in conjugal/community property still excluded
tip: "Estate Tax = 6% of (Gross Estate - Deductions - PHP 5M Standard Deduction)"
reference: "NIRC Section 84-86, as amended by TRAIN Law"
