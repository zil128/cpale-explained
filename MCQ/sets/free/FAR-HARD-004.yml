access-level: FREE
topic: 4
choices:
  choice1:
    label: "Present obligation from past event, probable outflow of resources, and reliable estimate of the amount"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "Future obligation, possible outflow of resources, and reasonable estimate"
    why-wrong-choice: "The obligation must be PRESENT (not future), outflow must be PROBABLE (not possible), and estimate must be RELIABLE"
  choice3:
    label: "Present obligation, certain outflow of resources, and exact amount determinable"
    why-wrong-choice: "Certainty is not required; 'probable' outflow and 'reliable estimate' (not exact) are the thresholds"
  choice4:
    label: "Legal obligation only, probable outflow, and best estimate available"
    why-wrong-choice: "Constructive obligations also qualify; the obligation need not be legal only"
explanation:
  short: "Provision recognition requires: (1) Present obligation, (2) Probable outflow, (3) Reliable estimate. All three!"

    Under PAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets', a provision is recognized when ALL THREE conditions are met:

    1. PRESENT OBLIGATION (legal or constructive) from a PAST EVENT
       - Legal obligation: from contract, legislation, or other operation of law
       - Constructive obligation: from entity's actions creating valid expectations

    2. PROBABLE outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
       - 'Probable' = more likely than not (>50%)
       - If only 'possible' = disclose as contingent liability (no recognition)

    3. RELIABLE ESTIMATE of the amount
       - Best estimate of expenditure required to settle
       - Can use expected value or most likely outcome
       - Only in extremely rare cases is estimate not possible

    IF ANY CONDITION IS NOT MET:
    - If not probable → disclose as contingent liability
    - If remote → no disclosure required
    - If no reliable estimate → disclose as contingent liability
tip: "Provision = Present + Probable + Estimable (all three required)"
reference: "PAS 37, Paragraph 14"
