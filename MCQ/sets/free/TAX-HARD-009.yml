choices:
  choice1:
    label: "Subject to 10% final withholding tax of PHP 50,000"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "Exempt from income tax as intercorporate dividend"
    why-wrong-choice: "Intercorporate dividend exemption under Sec. 27(D)(4) applies only to domestic corporations receiving dividends from another domestic corporation, not to individual taxpayers"
  choice3:
    label: "Subject to graduated income tax rates as part of gross income"
    why-wrong-choice: "Cash dividends from domestic corporations to resident citizens are subject to final tax under Sec. 24(B)(2), not regular income tax"
  choice4:
    label: "Subject to 15% final withholding tax if from a publicly-listed company"
    why-wrong-choice: "The 15% rate was eliminated by CREATE Law; dividends from domestic corporations are now uniformly taxed at 10% final tax regardless of listing status"
explanation:
  short: "Cash dividends from domestic corporations to individual resident citizens are subject to 10% final withholding tax under the NIRC as amended by CREATE Law."
  long: |
    Under Section 24(B)(2) of the NIRC as amended by RA 11534 (CREATE Law):

    1. Cash and property dividends received by resident citizens from domestic corporations are subject to a FINAL TAX of 10%
    2. This applies regardless of whether the corporation is publicly listed or closely held
    3. The tax is withheld at source by the payor corporation
    4. The CREATE Law unified the dividend tax rate at 10% (previously, listed companies had a 10% rate while others had varying rates)

    COMPUTATION:
    Cash dividend received: PHP 500,000
    Final tax rate: 10%
    Tax due: PHP 500,000 x 10% = PHP 50,000

    Note: The accumulated earnings and paid-up capital figures are provided as distractors. For tax purposes on individual recipients, only the amount of dividend and the source (domestic corporation) matter.
tip: "Individual + Dividend from Domestic Corp = 10% FINAL TAX (CREATE unified rate)"
