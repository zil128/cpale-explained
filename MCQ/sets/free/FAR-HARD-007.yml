explanation:
  short: "Defined benefit expense in P&L = Service Cost + Net Interest. Remeasurements go to OCI."

    Under PAS 19 'Employee Benefits', the defined benefit cost is split into THREE COMPONENTS:

    PROFIT OR LOSS (recognized in P&L):
    1. SERVICE COST
       - Current service cost (benefits earned this period)
       - Past service cost (plan amendments/curtailments)
       - Gain/loss on settlement
    2. NET INTEREST on net defined benefit liability/asset
       - = Net DB liability × Discount rate at start of period

    OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI):
    3. REMEASUREMENTS
       - Actuarial gains and losses (experience adjustments, assumption changes)
       - Return on plan assets (excluding interest income already in P&L)

    IN THIS CASE:
    - Service cost: PHP 800,000 → P&L
    - Net interest: PHP 500,000 → P&L
    - Total P&L expense: PHP 800,000 + PHP 500,000 = PHP 1,300,000

    Note: Remeasurements are recognized in OCI and are NOT reclassified to P&L in subsequent periods.
tip: "Pension P&L = Service Cost + Net Interest. Remeasurements = OCI only (never recycled)"
reference: "PAS 19, Paragraphs 120-130"
