    PARTNERSHIP LIQUIDATION - LOSS ABSORPTION CAPACITY

    In determining a partner's ability to absorb losses (for cash distribution purposes), you must consider the RIGHT OF OFFSET:

    RIGHT OF OFFSET:
    - If partner has a LOAN PAYABLE to partnership → REDUCES capital available
    - If partner has a LOAN RECEIVABLE from partnership → INCREASES capital available

    PARTNER A's POSITION:
    - Capital balance: PHP 100,000 (credit)
    - Loan payable to partnership: PHP 30,000 (partner owes partnership)
    - Net capital for loss absorption: PHP 100,000 - PHP 30,000 = PHP 70,000

    WHY OFFSET APPLIES:
    Under Article 1813 of the Civil Code and partnership law, when a partner owes the partnership:
    1. The loan payable is offset against capital
    2. Partner cannot receive distributions until loan is settled
    3. For insolvent partners, the loan reduces their ability to absorb losses

    PRACTICAL APPLICATION:
    - Maximum loss A can absorb before capital deficit = PHP 70,000
    - If losses exceed PHP 70,000, A will have a capital deficit
    - Since A is insolvent, other partners must absorb A's deficit
tip: "Loan PAYABLE to partnership = Deduct from capital. Loan RECEIVABLE = Add to capital."
