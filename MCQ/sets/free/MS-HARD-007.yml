text: "Quezon Manufacturing had the following results for 2025: Sales PHP 5,000,000, Variable costs PHP 3,000,000, Fixed costs PHP 1,500,000. If the company can increase sales by 20% with no change in the cost structure, what will be the percentage increase in operating income?"
access-level: FREE
topic: 114
choices:
  choice1:
    label: "80% increase due to operating leverage of 4.0"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "20% increase proportional to sales increase"
    why-wrong-choice: "Operating income does not increase proportionally with sales due to operating leverage; fixed costs remain constant, amplifying profit changes"
  choice3:
    label: "40% increase due to operating leverage of 2.0"
    why-wrong-choice: "Operating leverage = CM/Operating Income = PHP 2,000,000/PHP 500,000 = 4.0, not 2.0"
  choice4:
    label: "60% increase due to operating leverage of 3.0"
    why-wrong-choice: "The degree of operating leverage is CM (PHP 2,000,000) divided by Operating Income (PHP 500,000) = 4.0, not 3.0"
explanation:
  short: "DOL = Contribution Margin / Operating Income = PHP 2,000,000 / PHP 500,000 = 4.0. A 20% sales increase yields 20% x 4.0 = 80% profit increase."

    OPERATING LEVERAGE ANALYSIS:

    CURRENT SITUATION:
    Sales: PHP 5,000,000
    Variable Costs: PHP 3,000,000
    Contribution Margin: PHP 5,000,000 - PHP 3,000,000 = PHP 2,000,000
    Fixed Costs: PHP 1,500,000
    Operating Income: PHP 2,000,000 - PHP 1,500,000 = PHP 500,000

    DEGREE OF OPERATING LEVERAGE (DOL):
    Formula: DOL = Contribution Margin / Operating Income
    DOL = PHP 2,000,000 / PHP 500,000
    DOL = 4.0

    INTERPRETATION:
    Operating leverage of 4.0 means that for every 1% change in sales, operating income changes by 4%.

    PROJECTED INCREASE:
    Sales increase: 20%
    Operating income increase: 20% x 4.0 = 80%

    VERIFICATION:
    New Sales: PHP 5,000,000 x 1.20 = PHP 6,000,000
    New Variable Costs: PHP 3,000,000 x 1.20 = PHP 3,600,000 (60% of sales)
    New Contribution Margin: PHP 6,000,000 - PHP 3,600,000 = PHP 2,400,000
    Fixed Costs (unchanged): PHP 1,500,000
    New Operating Income: PHP 2,400,000 - PHP 1,500,000 = PHP 900,000

    Percentage increase: (PHP 900,000 - PHP 500,000) / PHP 500,000 = 80% ✓
tip: "Operating Leverage = CM/OI. High leverage = high risk/reward. Profit magnifies both ways!"
