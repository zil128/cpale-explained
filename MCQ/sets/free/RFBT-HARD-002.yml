access-level: FREE
topic: 143
choices:
  choice1:
    label: "No, H as holder in due course of a bearer instrument takes free of P's claim"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "Yes, because theft is a real defense available against all holders"
    why-wrong-choice: "Theft is a personal defense, not a real defense; HDC takes free of personal defenses including theft from prior holder"
  choice3:
    label: "Yes, because a stolen instrument cannot be negotiated"
    why-wrong-choice: "Bearer instruments can be negotiated by mere delivery; even a thief can negotiate to an HDC who takes good title"
  choice4:
    label: "No, but only if H can prove ignorance of the theft"
    why-wrong-choice: "HDC status is determined at time of taking; once established, the burden is not ongoing proof of ignorance"
explanation:
  short: "Bearer instruments are negotiated by delivery alone. A holder in due course takes free of personal defenses, including theft from a prior holder."

    NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS LAW - HOLDER IN DUE COURSE AND BEARER INSTRUMENTS:

    KEY PRINCIPLES:

    1. BEARER INSTRUMENT (Sec. 9, NIL):
       An instrument payable "to bearer" or "to P or bearer" is a bearer instrument.
       Negotiation: By mere delivery (Sec. 30)

    2. HOLDER IN DUE COURSE (Sec. 52, NIL):
       Takes the instrument:
       - Complete and regular on its face
       - Before overdue
       - In good faith and for value
       - Without notice of defect

    3. RIGHTS OF HDC (Sec. 57, NIL):
       Holds the instrument FREE from:
       - Defects of title of prior parties
       - Personal defenses available to prior parties

    4. REAL VS. PERSONAL DEFENSES:
       REAL DEFENSES (available against HDC):
       - Forgery, material alteration, minority, incapacity, illegality, fraud in factum

       PERSONAL DEFENSES (NOT available against HDC):
       - Theft, fraud in inducement, duress, breach of contract, lack/failure of consideration

    APPLICATION:
    - The note is a BEARER instrument ("to P or bearer")
    - T negotiated by delivery to H
    - H is an HDC
    - Theft is a PERSONAL defense
    - H takes FREE of P's claim

    P cannot recover from H. P's remedy is against T.
tip: "Bearer = delivery negotiates. HDC beats personal defenses (including THEFT). Only REAL defenses prevail against HDC."
