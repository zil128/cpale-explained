    REVENUE RECOGNITION - OVER TIME (PFRS 15)

    For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized based on progress toward completion.

    INPUT METHOD (Cost-to-Cost):

    Step 1: Calculate Percentage of Completion
    - Costs incurred to date: PHP 3,200,000
    - Total estimated costs: PHP 8,000,000
    - % Complete = PHP 3,200,000 ÷ PHP 8,000,000 = 40%

    Step 2: Calculate Revenue to Recognize
    - Contract price: PHP 10,000,000
    - Revenue = 40% × PHP 10,000,000 = PHP 4,000,000

    Step 3: Calculate Gross Profit
    - Revenue: PHP 4,000,000
    - Costs: PHP 3,200,000
    - Gross Profit: PHP 800,000

    VERIFICATION:
    - Expected total profit = PHP 10M - PHP 8M = PHP 2M
    - Profit recognized (40%) = PHP 800,000 ✓

    METHODS TO MEASURE PROGRESS:
    1. Input methods: Costs incurred, labor hours, machine hours
    2. Output methods: Units produced, contract milestones
tip: "Cost-to-Cost Method: Costs Incurred ÷ Total Costs = % Complete → Apply to Contract Price"
reference: "PFRS 15, Paragraphs 39-45"
