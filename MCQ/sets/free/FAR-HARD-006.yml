topic: 4
choices:
  choice1:
    label: "At the transaction price adjusted for the time value of money, with interest expense or income recognized separately"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "At the cash selling price without any adjustment for financing"
    why-wrong-choice: "PFRS 15.60-65 requires adjustment for significant financing component to reflect cash selling price"
  choice3:
    label: "At the total amount receivable including all financing charges"
    why-wrong-choice: "This would overstate revenue; financing component must be separated and recognized as interest"
  choice4:
    label: "Defer all revenue recognition until cash is fully collected"
    why-wrong-choice: "PFRS 15 requires revenue recognition when performance obligations are satisfied, adjusted for financing"
explanation:
  short: "Significant financing component = Adjust transaction price for time value of money. Interest is recognized separately."

    Under PFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers', when a contract contains a SIGNIFICANT FINANCING COMPONENT:

    TREATMENT:
    1. Adjust the transaction price for the TIME VALUE OF MONEY
    2. Use a discount rate that would be reflected in a separate financing transaction
    3. Recognize INTEREST separately from revenue over the financing period

    PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT (PFRS 15.63):
    Entity need NOT adjust for financing component if payment timing is ≤1 year from transfer of goods/services

    EXAMPLE: 
    - Customer pays PHP 1,210,000 in 2 years for goods delivered today
    - Cash selling price: PHP 1,000,000
    - Implicit interest rate: 10% per year
    
    Recognition:
    - Day 1: Revenue = PHP 1,000,000
    - Year 1: Interest income = PHP 100,000
    - Year 2: Interest income = PHP 110,000

    INDICATORS of significant financing:
    - Significant difference between promised consideration and cash price
    - Extended payment terms
    - Interest rate in contract
tip: "Financing component? Adjust to cash price + recognize interest separately"
reference: "PFRS 15, Paragraphs 60-65"
