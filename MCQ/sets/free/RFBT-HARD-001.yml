    label: "Z acquires valid ownership under the doctrine of seller in possession"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "Z acquires no ownership because Y had no title to transfer"
    why-wrong-choice: "While Y technically lacked full ownership, the Civil Code protects innocent purchasers when the seller is in possession with owner's consent"
  choice3:
    label: "Z acquires voidable ownership subject to X's right of rescission"
    why-wrong-choice: "Z's ownership is not voidable; as innocent purchaser for value from seller in possession, Z acquires absolute ownership"
  choice4:
    label: "Z acquires ownership only upon X receiving full payment from Y"
    why-wrong-choice: "Z's ownership is independent of Y's payment to X; Z's protection as innocent purchaser is immediate and unconditional"
explanation:
  short: "Under Article 1506 of the Civil Code, when a buyer (Y) is in possession with seller's consent and sells to an innocent purchaser for value (Z), Z acquires good title."

    DOCTRINE OF SELLER IN POSSESSION (Article 1506, Civil Code):

    When goods are sold by a person who is not the owner thereof but who is:
    (1) In possession of the goods, and
    (2) Selling with the consent of the owner (as in conditional sale)

    The buyer receives valid title IF the buyer:
    (1) Acted in good faith (innocent purchaser)
    (2) Paid value for the goods
    (3) Had no notice of the seller's lack of authority

    APPLICATION TO THE CASE:
    - X delivered goods to Y (Y is in possession with X's consent)
    - Y sold to Z before full payment (Y acting as seller in possession)
    - Z is an innocent purchaser for value
    - Z acquires VALID and ABSOLUTE ownership

    X's remedy is limited to pursuing Y for the unpaid balance. X cannot recover the goods from Z.

    This doctrine protects commercial transactions and the reliability of possession as evidence of ownership.

    RELATED PRINCIPLE: Nemo dat quod non habet (no one can give what they don't have) is EXCEPTED when the seller is in possession with the owner's consent.
tip: "Innocent purchaser + Seller in possession with owner's consent = VALID title passes (Art. 1506)"
