    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "PHP 500,000"
    why-wrong-choice: "This equals the contribution; bonus method adjusts capital based on agreed interest percentage"
  choice3:
    label: "PHP 300,000"
    why-wrong-choice: "This is 25% of old capital (1,200,000), ignoring C's contribution in total capital calculation"
  choice4:
    label: "PHP 325,000"
    why-wrong-choice: "Incorrect calculation; must compute 25% of total agreed capital after C's admission"
explanation:
  short: "Bonus method: C's capital = 25% × Total Capital. Difference from contribution is bonus from old partners."

    BONUS METHOD - ADMISSION OF A PARTNER

    Step 1: Compute Total Agreed Capital
    - Old capital: PHP 1,200,000
    - C's contribution: PHP 500,000
    - Total capital: PHP 1,700,000

    Step 2: Compute C's Capital Credit (25% interest)
    - C's capital credit = 25% × PHP 1,700,000 = PHP 425,000

    Step 3: Compute Bonus
    - C's contribution: PHP 500,000
    - C's capital credit: PHP 425,000
    - Bonus TO old partners: PHP 75,000

    Step 4: Allocate Bonus to Old Partners (60:40)
    - A's share: PHP 75,000 × 60% = PHP 45,000
    - B's share: PHP 75,000 × 40% = PHP 30,000

    JOURNAL ENTRY:
    Dr. Cash                        500,000
        Cr. A, Capital                          45,000
        Cr. B, Capital                          30,000
        Cr. C, Capital                         425,000

    KEY: C contributes MORE than credited → Bonus to OLD partners
    (If C contributed LESS than credited → Bonus FROM old partners to C)
tip: "Bonus Method: Total Capital × Interest % = New Partner Capital. Difference = Bonus"
