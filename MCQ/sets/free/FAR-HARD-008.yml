access-level: FREE
topic: 4
choices:
  choice1:
    label: "Allocate corporate assets to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis, or test impairment at the smallest group of CGUs to which corporate assets can be allocated"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "Exclude corporate assets entirely from impairment testing"
    why-wrong-choice: "PAS 36.102 requires corporate assets to be included in impairment testing at some level"
  choice3:
    label: "Recognize impairment only if the entire entity shows indicators of impairment"
    why-wrong-choice: "Impairment testing should be done at CGU or group of CGUs level, not only entity-wide"
  choice4:
    label: "Test corporate assets separately as individual assets"
    why-wrong-choice: "Corporate assets generally do not generate independent cash flows and cannot be tested individually"
explanation:
  short: "Corporate assets: Allocate to CGUs if possible, otherwise test at the smallest group of CGUs to which they can be allocated."

    Under PAS 36 'Impairment of Assets', CORPORATE ASSETS present a special challenge because they:
    - Do not generate independent cash inflows
    - Service multiple CGUs
    - Cannot be tested for impairment individually

    TREATMENT OF CORPORATE ASSETS:

    STEP 1: Try to ALLOCATE on reasonable and consistent basis
    - Allocate carrying amount to individual CGUs
    - Include allocated amount in CGU impairment test
    - Allocation basis must be reasonable (e.g., floor space, headcount)

    STEP 2: If allocation is NOT POSSIBLE
    - Identify the SMALLEST GROUP OF CGUs to which corporate assets can be allocated
    - Test impairment at that group level
    - Compare carrying amount (including corporate assets) to recoverable amount

    EXAMPLE: Head office building serving all divisions
    - Cannot allocate? Test impairment at entity level (all CGUs combined)
    - Impairment loss allocated to CGUs, then to assets within CGUs

    ALLOCATION OF IMPAIRMENT LOSS:
    1. First to goodwill (if any)
    2. Then to other assets pro-rata based on carrying amounts
tip: "Corporate assets: Allocate if possible → If not, test at smallest group of CGUs"
reference: "PAS 36, Paragraphs 100-103"
