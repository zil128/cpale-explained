    TYPES OF AUDIT OPINIONS (PSA 700, 705)

    1. UNMODIFIED OPINION (Clean Opinion)
       - Financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects
       - Prepared in accordance with applicable framework
       - No material misstatements, no scope limitations

    2. QUALIFIED OPINION ('Except for')
       - Misstatements are MATERIAL but NOT PERVASIVE, or
       - Unable to obtain sufficient evidence, but possible effects are material but not pervasive
       - Opinion: "Except for the effects of..."

    3. ADVERSE OPINION
       - Misstatements are MATERIAL AND PERVASIVE
       - Financial statements are misleading
       - Opinion: "Do not present fairly..."

    4. DISCLAIMER OF OPINION
       - Unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence
       - Possible effects are MATERIAL AND PERVASIVE
       - Opinion: "We do not express an opinion..."

    KEY DECISION FACTORS:
    - Is there a misstatement or inability to obtain evidence?
    - Is it MATERIAL? (affects users' decisions)
    - Is it PERVASIVE? (affects many elements, substantial portion, fundamental)
tip: "Unmodified = All good. Qualified = Material only. Adverse/Disclaimer = Material + Pervasive"
reference: "PSA 700, Paragraphs 16-19; PSA 705"
