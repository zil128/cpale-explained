    CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATES UNDER CREATE LAW

    DOMESTIC CORPORATIONS:
    - Regular rate: 25% of taxable income
    - Small corporations: 20% (net taxable income ≤ PHP 5M AND total assets ≤ PHP 100M, excluding land)

    RESIDENT FOREIGN CORPORATIONS:
    - Same as domestic: 25% of taxable income

    NON-RESIDENT FOREIGN CORPORATIONS:

    1. ENGAGED IN TRADE/BUSINESS IN THE PHILIPPINES:
       - 25% of taxable income from Philippine sources
       - Same rate as domestic corporations

    2. NOT ENGAGED IN TRADE/BUSINESS:
       - 25% of GROSS INCOME from Philippine sources
       - No deductions allowed (final tax)

    KEY DISTINCTION:
    - "Engaged in business" = subject to tax on NET income (after deductions)
    - "Not engaged in business" = subject to tax on GROSS income (no deductions)

    WHEN IS FOREIGN CORP "ENGAGED IN BUSINESS"?
    - Systematic, continuous, and regular business activities
    - Having a branch, office, or agent in the Philippines
    - Isolated or sporadic transactions do not constitute "engaged in business"
tip: "Foreign corp engaged in PH business = 25% on taxable income. Not engaged = 25% on GROSS."
reference: "NIRC Section 28(A), as amended by CREATE Law"
