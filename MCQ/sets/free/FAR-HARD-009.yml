text: "Under PFRS 16, a lessee enters a 5-year lease with annual payments of PHP 1,000,000. The interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. The lessee's incremental borrowing rate is 8%. What is the initial measurement of the lease liability?"

topic: 4
choices:
  choice1:
    label: "Present value of PHP 1,000,000 for 5 years at 8% discount rate"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "PHP 5,000,000 (total undiscounted payments)"
    why-wrong-choice: "PFRS 16 requires present value measurement, not nominal/undiscounted amount"
  choice3:
    label: "Fair value of the underlying asset"
    why-wrong-choice: "Fair value is used to determine if rate implicit exists; lease liability uses PV of payments"
  choice4:
    label: "Present value using risk-free rate"
    why-wrong-choice: "If implicit rate is not determinable, use incremental borrowing rate, not risk-free rate"
explanation:
  short: "Lease liability = PV of lease payments. Use implicit rate if determinable, otherwise use lessee's incremental borrowing rate."

    Under PFRS 16 'Leases', the LEASE LIABILITY is measured at the PRESENT VALUE of lease payments not yet paid.

    DISCOUNT RATE TO USE:
    1. FIRST CHOICE: Interest rate implicit in the lease
       - Rate that causes PV of lease payments + unguaranteed residual = Fair value of asset + Initial direct costs of lessor
    2. IF NOT READILY DETERMINABLE: Lessee's incremental borrowing rate
       - Rate the lessee would pay to borrow funds to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment

    LEASE PAYMENTS INCLUDE:
    - Fixed payments (less any lease incentives receivable)
    - Variable payments based on an index or rate
    - Residual value guarantees (amounts expected to be payable)
    - Exercise price of purchase option (if reasonably certain)
    - Termination penalties (if lease term reflects termination)

    CALCULATION:
    - Annual payment: PHP 1,000,000
    - Discount rate: 8% (incremental borrowing rate since implicit rate not determinable)
    - Lease liability = PHP 1,000,000 × PV annuity factor (5 years, 8%)
    - = PHP 1,000,000 × 3.9927 = PHP 3,992,700
tip: "Lease liability discount rate: Implicit rate first → If not, use incremental borrowing rate"
