choices:
  choice1:
    label: "Recognize the difference in other comprehensive income"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "Recognize the difference immediately in profit or loss"
    why-wrong-choice: "PFRS 9.5.6.5 specifically requires recognition in OCI for amortized cost to FVOCI reclassifications"
  choice3:
    label: "Adjust retained earnings as a prior period adjustment"
    why-wrong-choice: "Reclassifications are applied prospectively from reclassification date, not as prior period adjustments"
  choice4:
    label: "No adjustment is required as both categories use the same measurement"
    why-wrong-choice: "Amortized cost and FVOCI use different measurements; fair value adjustment is required upon reclassification"
explanation:
  short: "Amortized cost to FVOCI reclassification: measure at fair value, recognize difference in OCI."

    Under PFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', when reclassifying from amortized cost to FVOCI (debt):

    RECLASSIFICATION TREATMENT:
    1. Measure the financial asset at FAIR VALUE at the reclassification date
    2. Recognize the difference between amortized cost and fair value in OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
    3. The effective interest rate is NOT adjusted - continue using the original EIR
    4. Continue recognizing interest revenue in profit or loss

    WHY OCI? The OCI treatment is consistent with the FVOCI business model where:
    - Interest revenue goes to P&L (using EIR method)
    - Fair value changes go to OCI
    - Upon disposal, OCI is recycled to P&L

    CONTRAST: If reclassifying TO amortized cost (from FVOCI), the cumulative OCI is removed and adjusts the carrying amount.
tip: "Amortized Cost → FVOCI = Fair value difference to OCI (consistent with FVOCI model)"
reference: "PFRS 9, Paragraph 5.6.5"
