access-level: FREE
topic: 4
choices:
  choice1:
    label: "Apply the change prospectively using the exchange rate at the date of change for all items"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "Restate all prior period comparative financial statements retrospectively"
    why-wrong-choice: "PAS 21.35 requires prospective application from the date of change, not retrospective restatement"
  choice3:
    label: "Recognize the cumulative translation adjustment immediately in profit or loss"
    why-wrong-choice: "Translation differences remain in equity; they are not recycled to P&L upon functional currency change under PAS 21.37"
  choice4:
    label: "Continue using historical rates for all non-monetary items indefinitely"
    why-wrong-choice: "Non-monetary items are translated at the rate on the date of change, which becomes their new deemed cost"
explanation:
  short: "Functional currency changes are applied prospectively - translate everything at the new rate from the date of change."

    Under PAS 21 'The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates', when an entity changes its functional currency:

    1. The entity translates ALL items into the new functional currency using the exchange rate at the date of change
    2. The resulting translated amounts for non-monetary items are treated as their historical cost
    3. The change is applied PROSPECTIVELY from the date of change
    4. No retrospective restatement is required

    This is similar to an accounting policy change that cannot be applied retrospectively due to impracticability.

    EXAMPLE: If a Philippine subsidiary changes functional currency from USD to PHP on January 1, 2025, all assets and liabilities are translated at the January 1, 2025 rate. PPE translated at PHP 56 per dollar becomes the new 'historical cost' in PHP.
tip: "Functional currency change = PROSPECTIVE application (like impracticable accounting policy change)"
reference: "PAS 21, Paragraphs 35-37"
