    label: "PHP 50,000"
    why-wrong-choice: "This calculates 25% of ending inventory (500,000 × 40% × 25%), but markup is on COST not selling price"
  choice3:
    label: "PHP 100,000"
    why-wrong-choice: "This is total profit on sale; must isolate only the UNREALIZED portion in ending inventory"
  choice4:
    label: "PHP 32,000"
    why-wrong-choice: "This applies NCI percentage (80%); unrealized profit elimination is 100% regardless of NCI"
explanation:
  short: "Unrealized profit = Gross Profit Rate × Ending Inventory. Eliminate 100% regardless of ownership."

    INTERCOMPANY INVENTORY PROFIT ELIMINATION

    Step 1: Determine Gross Profit Rate
    - Markup on cost: 25%
    - If selling price = 125% of cost
    - Gross Profit Rate = 25/125 = 20% of selling price

    Step 2: Calculate Total Intercompany Sale
    - Sales from Sub to Parent: PHP 500,000

    Step 3: Calculate Ending Inventory from Intercompany
    - 40% remains unsold
    - Ending inventory (at transfer price): PHP 500,000 × 40% = PHP 200,000

    Step 4: Calculate Unrealized Profit
    - Unrealized profit = PHP 200,000 × 20% = PHP 40,000

    CONSOLIDATION ENTRY:
    Dr. Cost of Goods Sold      40,000
        Cr. Inventory                       40,000

    KEY POINTS:
    - Eliminate 100% of unrealized profit (not just parent's share)
    - For upstream sale (Sub → Parent), NCI bears their share of elimination
    - This is an UPSTREAM sale, so NCI share = 20% × PHP 40,000 = PHP 8,000
tip: "Markup on COST = Divide by (1 + markup rate) to get GP rate on selling price"
