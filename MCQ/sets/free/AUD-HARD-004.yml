text: "Which of the following statements about materiality in auditing is CORRECT under PSA 320?"
access-level: FREE
topic: 66
choices:
  choice1:
    label: "Performance materiality is set lower than overall materiality to reduce the risk that aggregate uncorrected misstatements exceed materiality"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "Materiality is a fixed percentage of net income for all entities"
    why-wrong-choice: "Materiality involves professional judgment and varies based on entity circumstances and user needs"
  choice3:
    label: "Once set at planning, materiality cannot be revised during the audit"
    why-wrong-choice: "PSA 320.12 requires the auditor to revise materiality if information becomes available that would have caused a different amount"
  choice4:
    label: "Performance materiality is always set at 50% of overall materiality"
    why-wrong-choice: "No fixed percentage exists; performance materiality is based on auditor judgment considering assessment of RMM"
explanation:
  short: "Performance materiality < Overall materiality. This provides a 'cushion' for undetected/uncorrected misstatements."

    MATERIALITY CONCEPTS (PSA 320)

    1. MATERIALITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS A WHOLE
       - Amount below which misstatements would not be expected to influence users' decisions
       - Benchmark + percentage (e.g., 5% of profit before tax, 1% of total revenue)

    2. PERFORMANCE MATERIALITY
       - Amount set LOWER than overall materiality
       - Applied to particular transactions, account balances, disclosures
       - Purpose: Reduce to appropriately low level the probability that aggregate of uncorrected/undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality

    3. THRESHOLD FOR MISSTATEMENTS TO ACCUMULATE
       - Amount below which misstatements are clearly trivial
       - Misstatements below this need not be accumulated

    WHY PERFORMANCE MATERIALITY IS LOWER:
    - Auditor may not detect all misstatements
    - Provides a buffer/cushion for undetected misstatements
    - Accounts for aggregation risk

    TYPICAL RANGES:
    - Performance materiality: 50-75% of overall materiality
    - Trivial threshold: Usually 3-5% of overall materiality
    - Higher % when lower RMM, fewer expected misstatements
tip: "Performance Materiality = Buffer zone. Always less than overall materiality."
