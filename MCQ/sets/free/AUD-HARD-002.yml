    AUDIT EVIDENCE - RECEIVABLES EXISTENCE

    CONFIRMATION is presumptively required for accounts receivable (PSA 505) because:
    - It provides EXTERNAL evidence (more reliable than internal)
    - It provides DIRECT evidence of existence (debtor acknowledges owing the amount)
    - It is INDEPENDENT of the client

    TYPES OF CONFIRMATIONS:

    POSITIVE CONFIRMATION:
    - Requests debtor to respond whether they agree or disagree
    - More reliable but lower response rate
    - Used when: Individual balances are large, risk is high, negative may be ignored

    NEGATIVE CONFIRMATION:
    - Requests response ONLY if debtor disagrees
    - Less reliable (no response could mean debtor ignored it)
    - Used when: Many small balances, low RMM, positive responses expected

    HIERARCHY OF EVIDENCE FOR EXISTENCE:
    1. External confirmation (BEST)
    2. Subsequent cash receipts (good, but internal)
    3. Review of invoices/shipping documents (tests occurrence, not existence)
    4. Analytical procedures (least direct)

    NOTE: For overstatement risk, auditors focus on EXISTENCE (items recorded may not exist)
tip: "Existence of receivables? Confirmation is the gold standard - external and direct."
