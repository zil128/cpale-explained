    SOLIDARY OBLIGATIONS - REIMBURSEMENT WITH INSOLVENCY (Article 1217, Civil Code):

    RULE: When a solidary debtor pays the entire obligation, they may seek reimbursement from co-debtors for their respective shares. If a co-debtor is INSOLVENT, the share of the insolvent shall be borne by ALL those who are solvent, including the debtor who paid, in proportion to their shares.

    GIVEN:
    - Total obligation: PHP 300,000
    - Solidary debtors: A, B, C (equal shares assumed)
    - A paid entire PHP 300,000
    - B is insolvent

    CALCULATION:

    Step 1: Determine individual shares
    A's share: PHP 100,000
    B's share: PHP 100,000 (insolvent)
    C's share: PHP 100,000

    Step 2: Allocate insolvent's share
    B's PHP 100,000 is divided between A and C proportionately:
    A absorbs: PHP 50,000
    C absorbs: PHP 50,000

    Step 3: Final amounts borne by each
    A: PHP 100,000 (own share) + PHP 50,000 (half of B's) = PHP 150,000
    C: PHP 100,000 (own share) + PHP 50,000 (half of B's) = PHP 150,000
    Total: PHP 300,000 ✓

    Step 4: Amount A can recover from C
    A paid: PHP 300,000
    A should bear: PHP 150,000
    A can recover from C: PHP 150,000
tip: "Insolvent co-debtor's share = split among ALL solvent debtors (including the one who paid) proportionately"
