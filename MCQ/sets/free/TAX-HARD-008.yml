    DONOR'S TAX UNDER TRAIN LAW

    TAX BASE FOR REAL PROPERTY:
    - HIGHER of:
      a) Fair market value per BIR (zonal value), or
      b) Fair market value per Provincial/City Assessor

    CALCULATION:
    - BIR zonal value: PHP 5,000,000
    - Assessor's FMV: PHP 4,000,000
    - Tax base: PHP 5,000,000 (higher value)

    DONOR'S TAX RATE (TRAIN Law):
    - Single rate: 6% of total gifts in excess of PHP 250,000
    - PHP 250,000 exemption per donor per year

    TAX COMPUTATION:
    - Taxable gift: PHP 5,000,000
    - Less: Exemption: (PHP 250,000)
    - Tax base: PHP 4,750,000
    - Donor's tax: PHP 4,750,000 × 6% = PHP 285,000

    OTHER RULES:
    - Donor's tax paid by DONOR (not donee)
    - Strangers: 30% of excess over PHP 250,000 (before TRAIN)
    - After TRAIN: Same 6% rate regardless of relationship
    - Tax due within 30 days from date of donation
tip: "Real property donation: Use HIGHER value (BIR vs Assessor). Rate = 6% of excess over PHP 250K."
