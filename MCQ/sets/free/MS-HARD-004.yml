text: "Davao Manufacturing allocates overhead using activity-based costing. Setup costs total PHP 240,000 with 80 setups. Product X requires 30 setups for 1,000 units while Product Y requires 50 setups for 5,000 units. Under traditional costing using direct labor hours (X: 2,000 DLH, Y: 8,000 DLH), how much LESS overhead would Product X receive compared to ABC?"

  choice1:
    label: "PHP 42,000 less under traditional costing"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "PHP 42,000 more under traditional costing"
    why-wrong-choice: "Traditional costing assigns Product X only PHP 48,000 (20% of overhead) while ABC assigns PHP 90,000 (37.5%); X receives LESS, not more, under traditional"
  choice3:
    label: "PHP 90,000 less under traditional costing"
    why-wrong-choice: "PHP 90,000 is the total ABC allocation to Product X, not the difference between the two methods"
  choice4:
    label: "PHP 48,000 less under traditional costing"
    why-wrong-choice: "PHP 48,000 is the traditional costing allocation to Product X, not the difference; the difference is PHP 90,000 - PHP 48,000 = PHP 42,000"
explanation:
  short: "ABC allocates PHP 90,000 to X (30/80 setups). Traditional allocates PHP 48,000 to X (2,000/10,000 DLH). Difference = PHP 42,000 less under traditional."

    COMPARISON OF ABC VS. TRADITIONAL COSTING:

    ACTIVITY-BASED COSTING (ABC):
    Cost Driver: Number of Setups
    Setup Cost Rate = PHP 240,000 / 80 setups = PHP 3,000 per setup

    Product X allocation:
    30 setups x PHP 3,000 = PHP 90,000

    Product Y allocation:
    50 setups x PHP 3,000 = PHP 150,000

    TRADITIONAL COSTING:
    Cost Driver: Direct Labor Hours
    Total DLH = 2,000 + 8,000 = 10,000 DLH
    OH Rate = PHP 240,000 / 10,000 DLH = PHP 24 per DLH

    Product X allocation:
    2,000 DLH x PHP 24 = PHP 48,000

    Product Y allocation:
    8,000 DLH x PHP 24 = PHP 192,000

    DIFFERENCE FOR PRODUCT X:
    ABC allocation: PHP 90,000
    Traditional allocation: PHP 48,000
    Difference: PHP 90,000 - PHP 48,000 = PHP 42,000

    Product X receives PHP 42,000 LESS under traditional costing.

    INSIGHT: Product X is a low-volume product requiring proportionally more setups (30/80 = 37.5%) relative to its DLH usage (2,000/10,000 = 20%). ABC correctly captures this complexity; traditional costing under-costs Product X and over-costs Product Y.
tip: "ABC reveals TRUE cost of complexity. Low-volume products with high setup needs are UNDER-costed by traditional methods."
