access-level: FREE
topic: 69
choices:
  choice1:
    label: "The inventory includes items requiring subjective valuation estimates"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "The entity has a simple, stable inventory system with few product lines"
    why-wrong-choice: "Simple, stable systems with few products suggest LOWER inherent risk"
  choice3:
    label: "Inventory turnover is consistent with industry norms"
    why-wrong-choice: "Consistent turnover suggests normal operations and lower inherent risk"
  choice4:
    label: "Physical inventory counts are conducted frequently"
    why-wrong-choice: "Frequent counts are a CONTROL that reduces detection risk, not an inherent risk factor"
explanation:
  short: "Subjective estimates, complexity, and susceptibility to manipulation increase inherent risk."

    INHERENT RISK FACTORS (PSA 315)

    Inherent risk is the susceptibility of an assertion to a misstatement that could be material, BEFORE considering related controls.

    FACTORS THAT INCREASE INHERENT RISK:

    1. COMPLEXITY
       - Complex calculations, transactions, valuations
       - Multiple locations, products, systems

    2. SUBJECTIVITY/ESTIMATION
       - Accounting estimates requiring significant judgment
       - Fair value measurements with unobservable inputs
       - Provisions, allowances, impairments

    3. SUSCEPTIBILITY TO THEFT/MANIPULATION
       - High-value, easily concealed items
       - Items subject to obsolescence
       - Management incentives to misstate

    4. CHANGE
       - New products, systems, or processes
       - Regulatory changes, new standards

    5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
       - Complex structures, unusual terms

    FOR INVENTORY SPECIFICALLY:
    - Obsolescence risk
    - Valuation at lower of cost and NRV
    - Complex costing methods (standard cost, ABC)
    - Multiple warehouse locations
    - Consignment arrangements
