    STOCK TRANSACTION TAX (Section 127, NIRC)

    FOR SHARES SOLD THROUGH PSE (LOCAL STOCK EXCHANGE):

    TAX RATE: 0.6% of GROSS SELLING PRICE
    - This is the ONLY tax on the transaction
    - No income tax or capital gains tax applies
    - Collected by the stock broker

    CALCULATION:
    - Gross selling price: PHP 5,000,000
    - Stock transaction tax: PHP 5,000,000 × 0.6% = PHP 30,000

    COMPARE WITH UNLISTED SHARES:
    
    For shares NOT traded through PSE:
    - 15% CAPITAL GAINS TAX
    - Based on NET CAPITAL GAIN (selling price - cost - expenses)
    - First PHP 100,000 of gain: 5% (optional)
    - Excess over PHP 100,000: 10%
    - (Note: Rates under Section 24(C) before CREATE amendments)

    WHY DIFFERENT TREATMENT?
    - PSE trading is encouraged for market liquidity
    - Stock transaction tax is simpler to administer
    - Tax is on gross sales, not gains (even if at a loss, STT applies)
tip: "PSE transaction = 0.6% STT on gross selling price. Not through PSE = 15% CGT on net gain."
