    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "PHP 3,000,000"
    why-wrong-choice: "This uses itemized deductions (10M - 7M); OSD replaces itemized deductions"
  choice3:
    label: "PHP 5,500,000"
    why-wrong-choice: "Incorrect OSD rate; OSD for corporations is 40% of gross income"
  choice4:
    label: "PHP 10,000,000"
    why-wrong-choice: "This ignores OSD entirely; OSD is 40% of gross income"
explanation:
  short: "OSD for corporations = 40% of gross income. Taxable income = Gross income - OSD."

    OPTIONAL STANDARD DEDUCTION (OSD)

    FOR CORPORATIONS:
    - OSD = 40% of GROSS INCOME
    - Available to both domestic and resident foreign corporations
    - In lieu of itemized deductions
    - Irrevocable election for the taxable year

    CALCULATION:

    Gross income:                    PHP 10,000,000
    Less: OSD (40% × 10M):          (PHP  4,000,000)
    Taxable income:                  PHP  6,000,000

    COMPARE WITH ITEMIZED:
    Gross income:                    PHP 10,000,000
    Less: Itemized deductions:      (PHP  7,000,000)
    Taxable income:                  PHP  3,000,000

    ANALYSIS:
    - Itemized results in lower taxable income (PHP 3M vs PHP 6M)
    - Corporation should have chosen ITEMIZED deductions
    - BUT once OSD is elected, it is IRREVOCABLE for that year

    FOR INDIVIDUALS:
    - OSD = 40% of GROSS SALES/RECEIPTS
    - Available to self-employed and professionals
    - Not available to compensation income earners

    WHY CHOOSE OSD?
    - Simpler compliance (no need to track expenses)
    - Fewer documentation requirements
    - Beneficial when actual deductions < 40%
tip: "Corporate OSD = 40% of Gross Income. Individual OSD = 40% of Gross Sales/Receipts."
reference: "NIRC Section 34(L), as amended by CREATE Law"
