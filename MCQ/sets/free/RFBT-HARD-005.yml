  choice1:
    label: "All parties after the forged indorsement: C, D, E, and both banks"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "Only the forger and the drawee bank that paid"
    why-wrong-choice: "All parties who took after a forged indorsement are liable; the drawee bank can pass liability upstream to collecting bank and prior transferees"
  choice3:
    label: "Only A (drawer) and the drawee bank"
    why-wrong-choice: "A drawer is not liable on forged indorsement; the loss falls on parties who took after the forgery, not the drawer"
  choice4:
    label: "Only E and the collecting bank as the last innocent parties"
    why-wrong-choice: "All parties in the chain after the forged indorsement are liable in the order of their indorsements under warranty liability"
explanation:
  short: "A forged indorsement breaks the chain of title. All subsequent parties (C, D, E, collecting bank) are liable. Drawee bank can recover from collecting bank."

    FORGED INDORSEMENT - LIABILITY CHAIN (NIL):

    RULE: A forged indorsement is wholly inoperative. No right to enforce the instrument can be acquired through a forged indorsement.

    CHAIN OF EVENTS:
    1. A draws check to B
    2. B indorses to C (FORGED - B's signature is forged)
    3. C indorses in blank
    4. D finds check, transfers to E
    5. E deposits in collecting bank
    6. Collecting bank collects from drawee bank

    ANALYSIS:

    Since B's indorsement was forged:
    - C acquired no title (took under forged indorsement)
    - D acquired no title
    - E acquired no title
    - Collecting bank acquired no title
    - Drawee bank paid on invalid instrument

    LIABILITY:
    1. DRAWEE BANK: Liable to drawer A for paying without proper indorsement
       (but can recover from collecting bank)

    2. COLLECTING BANK: Liable to drawee bank on warranty that all prior
       indorsements are genuine

    3. E: Liable to collecting bank on same warranty

    4. D: Liable to E on warranty

    5. C: Liable to D on warranty

    The loss ultimately falls on the party who dealt with the forger or earliest party after forgery who cannot pass liability further up.

    B (true owner) can recover from any party in the chain.
tip: "Forged INDORSEMENT = all parties after forgery liable. Contrast: Forged DRAWER signature = drawee bank bears loss."
