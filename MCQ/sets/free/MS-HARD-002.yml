text: "Manila Corp is evaluating an investment requiring PHP 2,000,000 initial outlay with expected annual cash inflows of PHP 600,000 for 5 years. The company's cost of capital is 12%. The present value factor for an ordinary annuity at 12% for 5 years is 3.6048. What is the profitability index and should the project be accepted?"

topic: 127
choices:
  choice1:
    label: "Profitability Index of 1.08; Accept the project"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "Profitability Index of 0.92; Reject the project"
    why-wrong-choice: "This incorrectly divides the initial investment by PV of inflows; PI = PV of inflows / Initial investment, not the inverse"
  choice3:
    label: "Profitability Index of 1.50; Accept the project"
    why-wrong-choice: "This uses undiscounted cash flows (PHP 3,000,000 / PHP 2,000,000 = 1.50); PI must use present value of future cash flows"
  choice4:
    label: "Profitability Index of 0.80; Reject the project"
    why-wrong-choice: "This calculation error likely used wrong PV factor or divided incorrectly; correct PI is 1.08"
explanation:
  short: "PI = PV of Cash Inflows / Initial Investment = (PHP 600,000 x 3.6048) / PHP 2,000,000 = 1.08. Since PI > 1, accept."

    PROFITABILITY INDEX (PI) ANALYSIS:

    The Profitability Index measures the present value of future cash flows per peso of initial investment.

    FORMULA: PI = Present Value of Cash Inflows / Initial Investment

    STEP 1: Calculate PV of Cash Inflows
    Annual Cash Inflow x PV Annuity Factor
    = PHP 600,000 x 3.6048
    = PHP 2,162,880

    STEP 2: Calculate Profitability Index
    PI = PHP 2,162,880 / PHP 2,000,000
    PI = 1.0814 or approximately 1.08

    DECISION RULE:
    - If PI > 1: Accept (PV of benefits exceeds cost)
    - If PI < 1: Reject (Cost exceeds PV of benefits)
    - If PI = 1: Indifferent (NPV = 0)

    Since PI = 1.08 > 1, the project should be ACCEPTED.

    VERIFICATION using NPV:
    NPV = PV of Inflows - Initial Investment
    NPV = PHP 2,162,880 - PHP 2,000,000 = PHP 162,880
    Positive NPV confirms acceptance decision.
tip: "PI > 1 means ACCEPT (every peso invested returns more than a peso in PV terms)"
