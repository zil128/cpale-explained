choices:
  choice1:
    label: "PHP 160,000 with PHP 40,000 bonus to old partners"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "PHP 200,000 equal to his contribution"
    why-wrong-choice: "Under bonus method, capital credit is based on percentage interest in new total capital, not contribution amount"
  choice3:
    label: "PHP 180,000 with PHP 20,000 bonus to old partners"
    why-wrong-choice: "D's 20% of new total capital (PHP 800,000) equals PHP 160,000, not PHP 180,000"
  choice4:
    label: "PHP 240,000 with PHP 40,000 bonus from old partners"
    why-wrong-choice: "The bonus goes TO old partners, not FROM them, since D is paying more than his proportionate capital credit"
explanation:
  short: "New total capital = PHP 800,000. D's 20% = PHP 160,000. Bonus to old partners = PHP 200,000 - PHP 160,000 = PHP 40,000."

    - Liabilities: PHP 400,000
    - Partners' Capital: PHP 600,000 (A: 240,000, B: 210,000, C: 150,000)

    Admission:
    - D contributes: PHP 200,000 cash
    - D's interest: 20%

    BONUS METHOD CALCULATION:

    Step 1: Calculate New Total Partnership Capital
    Old capital: PHP 600,000
    D's contribution: PHP 200,000
    New total capital: PHP 800,000

    Step 2: Calculate D's Capital Credit
    D's interest: 20%
    D's capital credit: PHP 800,000 x 20% = PHP 160,000

    Step 3: Calculate Bonus
    D contributed: PHP 200,000
    D's capital credit: PHP 160,000
    Bonus TO old partners: PHP 40,000

    Step 4: Allocate Bonus to Old Partners (by profit ratio)
    A (40%): PHP 40,000 x 40% = PHP 16,000
    B (35%): PHP 40,000 x 35% = PHP 14,000
    C (25%): PHP 40,000 x 25% = PHP 10,000
    Total: PHP 40,000 ✓

    FINAL CAPITAL BALANCES:
    A: PHP 240,000 + PHP 16,000 = PHP 256,000
    B: PHP 210,000 + PHP 14,000 = PHP 224,000
    C: PHP 150,000 + PHP 10,000 = PHP 160,000
    D: PHP 160,000
    Total: PHP 800,000 ✓
