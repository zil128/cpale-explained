    COMMUNICATION WITH THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE (PSA 260)

    MATTERS TO COMMUNICATE:

    1. FRAUD involving management (PSA 240)
       - ANY fraud involving management must be communicated
       - Regardless of amount/materiality
       - On a TIMELY basis

    2. SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES in internal control (PSA 265)
       - Deficiencies that merit attention of TCWG
       - In writing, on a timely basis

    3. OTHER MATTERS:
       - Auditor's responsibilities
       - Planned scope and timing of audit
       - Significant findings from the audit
       - Independence issues

    WHY TCWG FIRST?
    - TCWG have oversight responsibility
    - They need to take corrective action
    - They may need to investigate further
    - Professional standards require this communication

    WHEN FRAUD INVOLVES TCWG:
    - Consider obtaining legal advice
    - Communicate to next higher authority (shareholders, regulators)
    - May need to withdraw from engagement
tip: "Management fraud → Communicate to TCWG first, regardless of amount"
reference: "PSA 260, Paragraph 16; PSA 240, Paragraph 41"
