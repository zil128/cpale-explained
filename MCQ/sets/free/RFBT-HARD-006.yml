choices:
  choice1:
    label: "Y may continue the lease until expiry but must pay rent to Z prospectively"
    correct: true
  choice2:
    label: "Y must vacate immediately as sale terminates the lease"
    why-wrong-choice: "Under Art. 1676, the purchaser of leased property must respect the lease if it is recorded or if the buyer knew of it"
  choice3:
    label: "Y may demand rescission of sale as it prejudices his rights"
    why-wrong-choice: "Y has no right to rescind the sale; his protection is continuation of the lease, not preventing the sale"
  choice4:
    label: "Y may refuse to pay rent to Z until Z presents proof of ownership"
    why-wrong-choice: "Once Z proves ownership, Y must pay Z; Y cannot indefinitely withhold rent as defense"
explanation:
  short: "Sale of leased property does not terminate the lease. The buyer steps into the lessor's shoes. Y continues the lease but pays Z going forward."

    SALE OF LEASED PROPERTY (Articles 1676-1678, Civil Code):

    GENERAL RULE: The purchaser of leased property must respect the lease if:
    1. The lease is recorded in the Registry of Property, OR
    2. The purchaser knew of the existence of the lease at the time of sale

    Even if neither condition exists, the lessee has rights:
    - If lease has a fixed period: Buyer must allow lessee to continue for the remainder of the term
    - Buyer assumes all rights and obligations of the original lessor

    APPLICATION:

    1. Y's RIGHT TO CONTINUE LEASE:
       Y has a valid lease contract for 5 years. Z as buyer must respect this lease.
       Y can continue occupying the property until lease expiry (3 more years).

    2. RENT PAYMENT:
       - Payments made to X (old owner) BEFORE notice of sale: Valid, discharged Y's obligation
       - Payments AFTER proper notice of sale: Must be made to Z
       - Z should notify Y of the sale and demand future payments

    3. Y's PROTECTION:
       Y is not required to vacate. Z's remedy for unpaid rent (after notice) is to demand payment, not eviction (during lease term).

    4. DOCTRINE: "Emptio non tollit locatum" - Sale does not extinguish lease.
tip: "Buyer of leased property = new lessor. Lease continues. Rent goes to new owner AFTER notice."
