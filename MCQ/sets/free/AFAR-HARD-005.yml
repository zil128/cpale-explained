    HOME OFFICE AND BRANCH - INTERCOMPANY PROFIT ELIMINATION

    When Home Office bills Branch at more than cost, the Branch inventory is OVERSTATED by the unrealized markup.

    CALCULATION:

    Step 1: Understand the Billing Relationship
    - Billed price = 125% of cost
    - Therefore: Cost = 100%, Markup = 25%
    - Gross Profit Rate on billed price = 25% ÷ 125% = 20%

    Step 2: Calculate Unrealized Profit
    - Branch ending inventory (at billed price): PHP 250,000
    - Unrealized profit = PHP 250,000 × 20% = PHP 50,000

    ALTERNATIVE CALCULATION:
    - Cost = PHP 250,000 ÷ 1.25 = PHP 200,000
    - Unrealized profit = PHP 250,000 - PHP 200,000 = PHP 50,000

    ELIMINATION ENTRY (Combined Financial Statements):
    Dr. Shipments to Branch (or Allowance for Overvaluation)    50,000
        Cr. Branch Inventory                                            50,000

    The "Allowance for Overvaluation of Branch Inventory" is a contra-asset account used to reduce Branch inventory to cost.
tip: "125% of cost = 20% GP rate on billed price (25/125). Unrealized profit = Inventory × GP rate"
