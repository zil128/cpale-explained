## REVIEW NOTES

Financial	Instrument	(LO	1)	
	
Financial	instrument	is	a	contract	that	gives	rise	to:	
• a	financial	asset	of	one	entity;	and		
• a	financial	liability	or	equity	instrument	of	another	entity.	
	
Financial	asset	is	any	asset	that	is:	
1. Cash	
2. Equity	instrument	of	another	entity		
3. Contractual	right	to	(1)	receive	financial	asset	or	(2)	
exchange	financial	assets	or	financial	liabilities	under	
favorable	conditions;	or	
4. Certain	contract	settled	in	the	entity's	own	equity	
instruments.	
	
Financial	liability	is	any	liability	that	is:	
1. Contractual	obligation	to	(1)	deliver	financial	asset	or	(2)	
exchange	financial	assets	or	financial	liabilities	under	
unfavorable	conditions;	or	
2. Certain	contract	settled	in	the	entity's	own	equity	
instruments.	
	
Equity	instrument	is	any	contract	that	evidences	a	residual	
interest	in	the	assets	of	an	entity	after	deducting	all	of	its	
liabilities.	
	
Definition	of	Cash	and	Cash	Equivalents	(LO	2)	
	
Cash	comprises	cash	on	hand	and	demand	deposits.	
	
Cash	equivalents	are	short-term,	highly	liquid	investments	that	
are	readily	convertible	to	known	amounts	of	cash	and	which	
are	subject	to	an	insignificant	risk	of	changes	in	value.	
	
Composition	of	Cash	and	Cash	Equivalents	(LO	3)	
	
Cash	on	hand	
• Currencies	and	coins	
• Money	order	
• Bank	drafts	
• Checks	(cashier’s	check,	certified	check,	customer’s	check,	
manager’s	check,	personal	check,	traveler’s	check).	
However,	customer’s	postdated	check,	customer’s	
NSF/DAIF	check,	and	customer’s	stale	check	are	
EXCLUDED	from	cash	(treated	as	receivables).	
	
Cash	in	bank	
• Savings	account	
• Checking	or	current	account.	Checks	drawn	by	the	
company	are	deducted	from	cash	only	when	released	and	
negotiable.	Hence,	company’s	unreleased	check,	postdated	
check,	and	stale	check,	if	previously	deducted,	should	be	
added	back	to	the	company’s	cash.	

Time	deposits	(e.g.,	certificate	of	deposits,	money	market	
savings	certificates)	are	NOT	considered	as	cash.	However,	
they	may	be	considered	as	cash	equivalents.	
	
Compensating	balance	
• Not	legally	restricted	–	Cash.	
• Legally	restricted	–		
§ If	related	loan	is	short	term	–	Other	current	asset.	
§ If	related	loan	is	long	term	–	Other	non-current	asset.	
	
Foreign	bank	accounts	
• Not	legally	restricted	–	Cash.	
• Legally	restricted	–	Other	non-current	asset.	
	
Deposit	in	a	closed	bank

Bank	overdraft	
• Different	bank	–	Current	liability.	
• Same	bank	–	Deducted	from	cash.	
	
Cash	funds	
• Current	operation	–	Included	as	cash	
	
Cash	equivalents	
• Examples:		
1. Time	deposit	(a.k.a.,	certificates	of	deposit)	
2. Treasury	bills	
3. Investment	in	preference	share	with	redemption	date	
• Treatment:	
1. Within	3	months	–	Included	in	cash	equivalents.	
2. More	than	3	months	–	Excluded	from	cash	equivalents.	
a. Other	current	assets	if	maturity	is	within	12	mos.	
b. Other	non-current	assets	if	maturity	is	beyond	12	
mos.	
• Three-month	rule	test:	Counted	from	acquisition	date	to	
maturity	date.	
	
Non-cash	items	
1. I	Owe	You	(IOUs)	–	treated	as	receivables	
2. Postage	stamps	–	treated	as	supplies	
3. Credit	memo	from	suppliers	–	treated	as	contra	purchase	
account	
4. Cash	surrender	value	–	treated	as	investment	
5. Investment	in	shares	(equity	securities)	–	treated	as	
investment	
	
Internal	Control	for	Cash	(LO	4)	
	
• Segregation	of	duties	(e.g.,	employees	who	are	permitted	
access	to	cash	should	not	also	have	access	to	the	
accounting	records	for	cash).		
• Daily	deposit	of	cash	receipts.	
• Payments	should	be	made	by	checks.
Properly	authorized	persons	should	sign	checks.	
• Monthly	bank	reconciliation	should	be	prepared.	
	
Petty	Cash	Fund	(LO	5)	
	
Petty	cash	fund	(PCF)	is	a	small	amount	of	cash	on	hand	used	
to	pay	small	expenses	impractical	to	pay	by	check.	Two	(PCF)	
systems:

Cash	and	cash	equivalents	are	presented	as	current	assets	
unless	restricted	from	being	exchanged	or	used	to	settle	a	
liability	for	at	least	twelve	months	after	the	reporting	period.	
	
An	entity	shall	disclose	the	amount	of	significant	cash	and	cash	
equivalent	balances	held	by	the	entity	that	are	not	available	for	
use.

Cash Equivalents  
Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and so near their

estimated realizable or recoverable value and is presented as Receivables.

in the notes to financial statements.

Compensating Balance 
The minimum amount to be maintained in a bank account to act as collateral for the payment of a depositor’s 
loan.  Its presentation in the financial statements is dependent on whether the balance is legally restricted or unrestricted:
  
1. Legally restricted compensating balance if held as collateral for: 
a. Short-term borrowing--Shown  separately under current assets but not part of “Cash and Cash  
    Equivalents”. 
b. Long-term borrowings—Shown separately as non-current asset either as Long-term Investments or  
    Other Assets
