REVIEW	NOTES	
	
Depreciation  
 
Is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an 
asset over its estimated useful life.  Depreciation is cost 
allocation rather than asset valuation. 
 
Depreciation begins when it is available for use and 
depreciation ceases when the asset is derecognized.  Even if 
the asset is not being used or idle, the depreciation 
continues.  
 
The following are the characteristics of a property, plant and 
equipment: 
 
 
Straight-Line Depreciation Method 
 
Annual depreciation charges are equal over the number of 
years of estimated useful life.  
 
The principle in straight-line method considers depreciation 
as a function of time rather than as a function of usage. 
 
Cost – Residual value = Depreciation Estimated useful life 
 
Residual value (RV) = Estimated selling price after useful life 
less cost to sell. 
 
 
Accelerated Depreciation Method 
 
Provides higher depreciation in the earlier years and lower 
depreciation in the later years of the useful life of the asset.  
There are three accelerated depreciation methods, namely: 
 
a. Sum-of-years’ digit method 
b. Double declining balance method 
c. 150% declining balance method 
 
The principle under accelerated depreciation is that, new 
assets are generally more efficient during the earlier years 
than in the later years. 
 
 
Sum-of-years’ Digit Method 
 
Depreciation under this method is computed as follows: 
 
Cost – RV  x 
Useful life – Age  
= Depreciation Exp. Summation of digits 
in the useful life 
 
 
Double Declining Balance Method 
 
Depreciation under this method is computed as follows: 
 
 Cost      XX 
Less: Accumulated depreciation – beg. (XX) 
 
 Carrying amount    XX  
Times: Depreciation rate    X% 
 
 Depreciation expense    XX 
 
Residual value will be considered only in the last year of the 
useful life.  While the depreciation rate is computed as: 
 
2 = Depreciation Rate Estimated useful life 
 
 
Variable Charge or Activity Method 
 
The variable or activity methods assume that depreciation is 
more a function of use rather than passage of time.  There 
are two variable methods, namely: 
 
a. Working hours method 
b. Output or production method 
 
Working Hours and Output Method 
 
Depreciation under this method is computed as follows: 
 
Cost – RV  x 
Actual output/hours 
During the year 
= Depreciation Exp. Total estimated 
output/hours over 
the useful life

Change in Depreciation  
 
A new depreciation expense should be computed if any of 
the following is present: 
 
a. Change (additional) in the capitalized cost 
b. Change in estimated useful life 
c. Change in residual value 
d. Change in depreciation method 
e. Impairment loss 
f. Revaluation surplus 
 
 
Computation of New Depreciation 
 
Step 1:  Compute the carrying amount on the date of change 
in estimate: 
 
 Original cost     XX 
Less: Accumulated depreciation  (XX) 
Less: Accumulated impairment  (XX) 
Add: Additional capital expenditure   XX 
 Carrying amount – change in est.  XX 
 
Step 2:  Apply changes and use the carrying amount on the 
date of change as the new basis of depreciation: 
 
Carrying amount at date of change in 
est. – New residual value = Depreciation Exp. New estimated remaining  
useful life 
 
 
Capital Expenditure and Revenue Expenditure 
 
Revenue expenditure are expenditure that will only benefit 
the current period.  This cost is reported as an expense.  
 
Capital expenditure are expenditure that will benefit the 
current period and the future period.  This cost is capitalized 
and reported as an asset.  Cost will benefit the future periods 
when: 
 
• It extends the life of the property 
• It increases the capacity of the property 
• Improves the efficiency and safety of the property 
 
Summary of treatment to expenditures: 
 
• Additions – capitalize 
• Improvement or betterment – capitalize 
• Replacement – capitalize  
• Extraordinary repair – capitalize 
• Ordinary repair – expense  
• Rearrangement cost – expense  
 
 
Composite and Group Depreciation 
 
This depreciation method computes a single depreciation 
amount for the depreciation of many individual assets.    
 
Composite life: 
 
Cost – Residual value = Composite Life Annual depreciation of the group 
 
Composite rate: 
 
Annual depreciation of the group = Composite Rate Cost 
 
Subsequent Depreciation Under Composite Method 
 
The composite rate is only computed once and that rate will 
be used in the subsequent year even if there was a 
acquisition or disposal.   
 
The subsequent depreciation expense using the composite 
method is computed as follows: 
 
 Original cost of the group   XX 
Add: Cost of newly acquired PPE   XX 
Less: Cost of retired PPE   (XX) 
 
 Updated cost      XX 
Times: Composite rate     X% 
 
 Depreciation expense    XX 
 
 
Disposal of PPE Under Composite Method 
 
No gain or loss are recognized when a PPE is sold under the 
composite method.  The accumulated depreciation of PPE 
sold is computed as follows: 
 
Cost       XX 
Times: Selling price of PPE sold   X% 
 
 Accumulated depreciation   XX 
 
Retirement Method  
 
Depreciation under this method is computed as follows: 
 
 Cost of sold PPE    XX 
Less: Selling price of PPE sold  (XX) 
 Depreciation expense for the year  XX 
 
Replacement Method  
 
Depreciation under this method is computed as follows: 
 
 Acquisition cost of new PPE to 
       replace the PPE sold   XX 
Less: Selling price of PPE sold  (XX) 
 Depreciation expense for the year  XX 
 
Inventory Method  
 
Depreciation under this method is computed as follows: 
 
Specific PPE account (e.g., tools) 
Tools – beg.  XX   
Cost of new acquisition XX XX Selling price – sold  
  XX Depreciation (squeeze) 
Tools – end  XX   
 
Gain or Loss on Disposal of PPE 
 
Step 1:  Compute the carrying amount on the date of 
disposal. 
 
 Cost       XX 
Less: Accumulated depreciation  (XX) 
 Carrying amount on sale   XX  
 
Step 2:  Compute the gain or loss on sale 
 
 Net selling price     XX 
Less: Carrying amount on sale  (XX) 
 Gain or (loss) on sale    XX

REVIEW	NOTES	
	
Revaluation Model – The PPE are measured subsequently 
at revalued amount.  This is the fair value less subsequent 
depreciation and impairment.  If the company used 
revaluation model on an item of PPE, the entire class of PPE 
to which that asset belongs shall be revalued. 
 
Cost Model VS. Revaluation Model 
 
1. Increase in Value of the Asset: 
 
 Cost Model Revaluation Model 
Without 
prior 
impairment 
Do not recognize 
Recognize as 
“revaluation surplus 
(RS)” 
With  
Prior  
Impairment  
Recognize as 
“Gain on reversal” 
Recognize as  
“Gain on reversal 
And revaluation surplus” 
 
 
2. Decrease in Value of the Asset

“Impairment loss” 
 
Recognize as 
“Impairment loss” 
With  
Prior  
Revaluation 
Not applicable 
Recognize as 
“Deduction to RS and 
Impairment loss” 
 
Revalued Amount – is either: 
1. Fair value or Sound Value – the price that would be 
received to sell an asset. 
 
2. Depreciated Replacement Cost (DRC) – determine from 
the amount that would be required currently to replace 
the asset (replacement cost) adjusted for any 
depreciation based on the replacement cost. 
 
Timing of Revaluation: 
• Volatile PPE – Annual revaluation is necessary. 
• Not volatile PPE – Every 3 to 5 years. 
 
 
Revaluation Surplus – is type of earnings that is not yet 
realized that is why, these earnings are presented in the other 
comprehensive income.  Once realized, revaluation surplus is 
transferred to retained earnings (RE) so it can now be 
declared as dividends. 
 
PROCESS OF ACCOUNTING FOR REVALUATION AND 
COMPUTATIONS: 
 
1. “Whole” revaluation surplus (date of revaluation):  
 
Revalued - FV/SV/DRC (a)    XX 
Less:  Carrying amount (b)   (XX)  
Whole revaluation surplus    XX 
 
a. Revalued amount – if the “fair value” is given, no 
more computation is needed, however, if 
“replacement cost” is given, DRC is computed as 
follows: 
 
Replacement cost (RC)    XX 
Less: Acc. Dep [(RC/life) * age]  (XX) 
Depreciated replacement cost   XX 
 
b. Carrying amount     
 
Cost      XX 
Less:  Acc. Dep [(Cost/life) * age] (XX) 
Carrying amount    XX 
  
2. “Remaining” revaluation surplus (subsequent to date of 
revaluation): 
 
Whole revaluation surplus (see above)  XX 
Less:  Amount transferred to R.E. (a) (XX) 
Remaining revaluation surplus   XX 
 
a. Amount transferred to retained earnings: 
 
(For depreciable asset) 
 
Whole revaluation surplus = Annual transfer Remaining useful life 
  
(For non-depreciable asset) 
100% when the revalued asset is sold, 0% if not sold.

Reminders: 
• Revaluation surplus should be net of tax. 
• In computing the accumulated depreciation of DRC, use 
the original useful life but the new residual value.  
 
 
TWO Approaches In Recording Revaluation: 
 
1. Proportional Approach – the principal account and 
the contra-account of the PPE will be increased by 
the percentage of increase from the revaluation. 
 
Whole revaluation surplus = % of increase Carrying amount 
 
2. Elimination Approach – the contra-account will be 
reduced by the amount of revaluation. 
 
 
New Depreciation – Revaluation is a change in estimate.  
When an asset is revalued, the depreciation expense for this 
asset will change.  The basis for the new depreciation is the 
revalued amount (FV/SV/DRC) which will be spread out to the 
remaining useful life. 
 
FV/SV/DRC = New Depreciation Remaining useful life 
 
 
Impairment of Previously Revalued Asset – the decrease 
in value is recognize as deduction to the remaining 
revaluation surplus and the balance is treated as impairment 
loss. 
 
COMPUTATION:  
 
 Carrying amount on impairment (a)  XX 
 Less:  Recoverable amount (b)  (XX) 
 
 Total loss     XX 
 Less:  Remaining revaluation sur. (c) (XX) 
 
 Impairment loss     XX 
 
 
a. Carrying amount  
 
Carrying amount on revaluation (FV/SV/DRC)  XX 
Less:  New depreciation    (XX) 
Carrying amount on impairment    XX 
 
b. Recoverable amount 
 
Fair value less cost to sell   XX 
Versus:  Value-in-use    XX 
Recoverable amount (select higher)  XX 
 
c. Whole revaluation surplus (see above)   XX 
Less:  Amount transferred to R.E.   (XX) 
Remaining revaluation surplus    XX 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revaluation of Previously Impaired Asset – under the cost 
model the subsequent increase in value is limited only to the 
reversal limit, while under revaluation there is no limit as to its 
increase in value.  
 
COMPUTATION:  
 
Revalued amount (FV/SV/DRC)    XX

PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT 
 
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) – (PAS 16) are tangible assets that are; 
a) Are held for use in the production or supply of goods and services, for rental to others, or for 
administrative purposes; and 
b) Are expected to be used during more than one accounting period. 
 
Measurement at Initial Recognition - At Cost, the components of which are: 
a) Purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade 
discounts and rebates. 
b) Costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable 
of operating in the manner intended by management; and 
c) The initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it 
is located. 
 
Purchase Price of PPE Depending on the Mode of Acquisition 
a) Cash Purchase – purchase price is the amount of cash that is paid  
b) Purchase on Account with Available Cash Discount – purchase price is the invoice price less cash discount 
whether taken or not  
c) Purchase under Deferred Payment Plan – purchase price is the cash equivalent prince 
d) Acquisition by Issuance of Equity Securities – purchase price is the fair value of the PPE acquired 
e) Acquisition by Donation – PPE is valued at their fair values 
f) Acquisition through Non-Monetary Exchange – PPE is valued at follows: 
1. Transaction with Commercial Substance: 
                                     Fair Value of the old asset          Pxxx 
                                     Cash Paid                                   xxx or 
                                     Cash Received                           (xxx) 
                                      Valuation of New Asset              Pxxx 
                                         
2.  Transaction Lacking  of Commercial Substance: 
                       Carrying Value of the old asset     Pxxx 
                                     Cash Paid                                    xxx or 
                                     Cash Received                            (xxx) 
                                                                                     Pxxx 
     Examples of Directly Attributable Costs 
a. Costs of site preparation 
b. Initial delivery and handling costs 
c. Installation and assembly costs 
d. Costs of testing whether the asset is functioning net of proceeds from the sale of any produce while 
bringing the asset to the location and condition for it to function as intended 
 
Subsequent Costs of Property Plant and Equipment-examples are replacements of parts, inspection 
costs, repairs and maintenance costs.  These subsequent costs are capitalized when the asset recognition 
criteria are met, and the cost of the replaced part are derecognized.  Below are indicators that the subsequent 
costs are to be capitalized: 
• An extension in asset’s estimated life; 
• An increase in output capacity; 
• A substantial improvement in product quality or service potential, and 
• Significant reduction in previously assessed operating costs 
 
Depreciation – is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.

Double-Declining Balance            (Cost – Accumulated Depreciation, Beg)  x    2/Total Life in Years 
 
150% Declining-Balance              (Cost – Accumulated Depreciation, Beg)  x   1.5/Total Life in Years 
 
Valuation at Reporting Date – a choice of either the Cost Model or the Revaluation Model: 
 
Cost Model- the class of PPE shall be carried at cost less accumulated depreciation any accumulated 
impairment loss 
 
Revaluation Model- the class of PPE shall be carried at revalued amount less any subsequent accumulated 
depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses

PROBLEM 2: (COMPREHENSIVE: INITIAL AND BS MEASUREMENT) 
Braid Corp. started business on January 1, 2019, by purchasing two equipment having the following list prices: 
Equipment A    
P800,000 
Equipment B     
750,000 
These equipment were acquired under credit term of 10/10, n/30. The company failed to pay within the discount 
period. The assets were recorded at the total amount paid.  Since the date of purchase, the company has charged 
depreciation at 20% on the balance of the asset account at the end of each year.   The amount of depreciation 
computed on each year has been credited directly to the asset account.  Moreover, all purchases since the 
inception of the operations have been debited to the equipment account.  Cash proceeds from the disposal of 
equipment were credited to the same account. 
All the Equipment were estimated to have a useful life of 5 years and were supposed to be depreciated under the 
straight-line method. Salvage value on all equipment is estimated at 10% of the correct initial cost. 
Your first-time audit of the equipment account in 2021 revealed the following information: 
• On March 31, 2019, Equipment C was purchased on an installment basis at total installment price of 
P1,080,000.  The installment contract called for 12 monthly payments of P90,000.  The equipment had a 
cash price of P850,000.  Freight and handling charges including insurance while in transit amounting to 
P30,000 was incurred and charged as outright expense. The company recorded Equipment C at the total 
installment price. 
• On June 30, 2020, Equipment D was purchased by paying P400,000 cash down-payment and issuing 
P1,200,000 note payable due at P400,000 annually thereafter. The company incurred P60,000 in 
installation cost and is estimated to incur P69,202 in dismantling cost upon its retirement. The market 
rate of interest on this date was at 12%. The company recorded the equipment at P1.6M and charged the 
installation cost to expense. 
• On September 30, 2020, Equipment E was acquired in exchange of a parcel of land located. The equipment 
had a fair value of P920,000. The land had a carrying value of P1.4M and a fair market value of P1.5M. 
Cash amounting to P580,000 was received from the exchange. Future cash flows related to the assets 
exchanged are considered significant. The company recorded the equipment at the book value of the land 
given up net of the cash received. 
• On March 30, 2021, Equipment B was traded for Equipment F, which had a cash price of P1,050,000.  The 
company paid P500,000 in the trade-in transaction.  The company recorded the trade-in by debiting the 
equipment account for the cash payment. 
• On July 1, 2021, Equipment C was sold for P500,000.  The company incurred cost to sell on the machinery 
amounting to P8,000.  The equipment account was credited for the net cash received.  
Requirements:  
1. What is the gain or loss on exchange on September 30, 2020?

PROBLEM 5: (COST MODEL: IMPAIRMENT LOSS) 
 
The Kit Corp. is assessing one of its factories for impairment as of December 31, 2021 due to a competitor 
launching a more superior product rivaling the product line being produced by the factory.  The factory produces 
one of the company’s product lines and is considered a separate cash generating unit from the rest of its other 
factories. The assets in the factory included the Land (Cost: P1M); Building (Cost: P6M) and an Equipment (ABC) 
(Cost: P2M) which were acquired in January of 2018 (when the product line has been launched). Another 
Equipment (DEF) (Cost: P3M) was acquired in January of 2020 (when the product line was expanded).  The 
building had a useful life of 20 years while the equipment were estimated to have a useful life of 10 years. Assets 
are being depreciated under the straight-line method to zero residual value.

FARAP-4404 
 
 
Individual cash flows related to each asset comprising the factory cannot be ascertained thus you suggested that 
the company treat the factory as a single cash generating unit for the purpose of applying PAS 36, Impairment 
of assets.  A cash generating unit as defined by the said standards is the smallest identifiable group of assets that 
generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.  
 
As a result of the introduction of a more superior product by the competitor, the client ascertained that the product 
being currently produced by the factory can now only generate cash flows for the company for the next five years, 
after which the assets in the factory can be disposed for a total of lump-sum of P1.4M. The following presents the 
estimates of the said cash flows (pre-tax):  
 
Year   Revenues  Expense, excluding 
Depreciation 
2022   P4,200,000  P1,680,000 
2023     3,800,000    1,910,000 
2024     3,200,000    2,050,000 
2025     2,400,000    1,610,000 
2026     1,300,000       800,000 
 
The fair value of the group of assets net of estimated disposition costs was determined to be P6.5M.  The prevailing 
pre-tax discount rate appropriate for this analysis is 6% while post-tax discount rate is at 8%. 
 
Requirements: 
1. What is the value in use of the group of assets? 
2. How much is the recoverable amount of the group of assets? 
3. How much is the impairment loss? 
4. Assuming that the land had a fair market value less cost to sell at P1.2M what is the carrying value of the 
building after impairment loss recognition? 
 
PROBLEM 6:  (REVALUATION MODEL) 
 
Seth Company acquired a machine on January 1, 2018, at a cost of P1,500,000.  It was expected to have a useful 
economic life of 10 years.  The comany uses the straight-line method in depreciating its machinery and equipment 
and reports on a calendar year basis.   
 
On December 31, 2021, the machine was appraised as having a gross replacement cost of P2,700,000.  Seth  
applies the revaluation model in valuing this class of property, plant, and equipment after its initial recognition. 
 
Requirements: 
1. How much is the depreciation expense in 2022? 
2. How much is the balance of the revaluation surplus account on December 31, 2022, assuming that the 
company uses the “Piecemeal basis” of transferring the revaluation surplus to retained earnings? 
3. What is the carrying value of the machine on December 31, 2022? 
4. Assuming that the machinery was sold on December 31, 2023, at P1,400,000, what is the gain or loss to 
be recognized in the profit or loss for 2023 and how much revaluation surplus should be transferred as a 
“lump-sum” to retained earnings? 
5. Assuming that the fair market value of the equipment is P2.45M on December 31, 2021, what is the 
balance of the revaluation surplus on December 31, 2022, if the “Piecemeal basis” of transferring the 
revaluation surplus to retained earnings is adopted?
